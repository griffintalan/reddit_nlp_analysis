Are you willing to steal the highest office? If yes here is the plan!,"Have Pelosi propose to Trump that the elections be postponed till february first of next year due to corona, letting him think he has a 6 month buffer. Trump would get the Senate to stupidly pass the bill.

On January 20th per the constitution, the line of succession activate and the current president and vice president are forced out and ineligible to run again if no elections have been held.

At that point, the election would be held just 10 days after, the Democratic nominee is the only major candidate eligible on the ballot.

Not only would that throw off the presidential election but you would likely see a lot of down ballot vote splitting between the libertarians and the GOP candidates.

The misreported nature of the new coronavirus vs the cost of lives in economic depressions.,"How much are we over-correcting for China and Italy's misinformation/underestimation of the risks of the coronavirus, with our own misinformation, and underestimation of the deaths from economic depression?

Only \~10% of the ""*deaths with coronavirus""* in Italy are actually ""*deaths from coronavirus*"" - due to the atypical way Italy reports information on those that die, yet the Italian National Health Institute keeps trying to stop the widespread misreporting (almost all media, and stats websites/maps are incorrectly reporting *all* of these deaths as ""*death from coronavirus*"") and no-one is listening in the panic - as some of their ICU's are clearly overburdened, along with fear of a making an underestimation as happened in Wuhan (with total misinformation campaign), and happened in Italy, who did not realise the threat specific to their population and health system.

The expected death rate in Italy per day is \~1,600 at this time of year, and only those that die are guaranteed to be tested (it is or will soon be the case that a *majority* of people in northern Italy either have or will have had the coronavirus, the majority of those are symptom free, almost none are tested), and unsurprisingly, many of the deceased had coronavirus. Only \~10% of Italy's daily deceased-test-positive for coronavirus actually died in an ICU, the rest were mostly part of Italy's expected daily deaths, 99% of the ""*deaths with coronavirus*"" had *at least* one chronic disease, but happened to have coronavirus when they died.

Europe's most overburdened ICUs were always going to be those in northern Italy at this time because:

* They have an increasingly ageing population, now the 2nd oldest population in the world
* Northern Italy has by far the worst air pollution in Europe, causing dangerous smog
* They've had low deaths in previous years in the cold/flu season (can be up to e.g. 60,000 people a year in e.g. the UK), increasing the pool of old and chronically ill people that might be expected to die this year.

Some Herpesviruses are carried by over 90% of the population worldwide - if everyone who died in northern Italy on a daily basis was tested for ""herpes"", and declared to have ""died with herpesvirus"", but then widely reported as ""died from herpesvirus"" - while some \~48 % of these people had been symptom free of herpes their entire lives.. We'd have hundreds of ""herpes symptom free ... deaths from herpesvirus"" being reported, which is ludicrous. Well, we now have likely hundreds of ""coronavirus symptom free ... deaths from coronavirus"" being reported/misrepresented - which is batshit crazy - and sending the whole world into panic. Don't believe me? The average age of those dying in northern Italy *with coronavirus* is 81. Again, 90% of these deaths are not happening in ICU's. 48% of 80-89 year-olds with coronavirus on the Diamond Princess were *symptom free*, probably a very similar number to the many of the mystery 90% ""*deaths with coronavirus""* in Italy, reported as ""*deaths from coronavirus*"", that do not have coronavirus/COVID-19 as a cause of death on their death certificate at all, dying outside of their otherwise overburdened ICUs, of whom almost all, over 99% have *at least* one major chronic disease, in their 70s, 80s and 90s.

Excess mortality has not significantly increased in any country in the world, yet people are claiming an apocalyptic/dramatic fatality rate of 5% coming out of Italy based on this widespread misreporting. The Diamond Princess (worse case with many old aged people) has about 0.6% and Germany, with now \~40,000 cases - below 0.6%, at about 0.55%. The Swiss government claimed that the situation in southern Switzerland (next to Italy) is ""dramatic“, yet local doctors say everything is normal.

Especially check out the recent daily updates from this Swiss doctor:

[https://swprs.org/a-swiss-doctor-on-covid-19/](https://swprs.org/a-swiss-doctor-on-covid-19/)

Yes it's potentially dangerous to some people, and every death from coronavirus is tragic - they are happening, and some health systems are struggling with the demand of looking after so many of our frail, many of whom will have to risk the coronavirus, and where it happens it should be reported on accurately - but there will be no front line from which to report economic collapse, these people will suffer in silence. Committing suicide to avoid homelessness, mental health issues from the lack of opportunity, or the stress of uncertainty. These issues are potentially colossal, and being downplayed/ignored, while the risk from coronavirus is being pornographed to the world.

Having a virus that can overburden your heath system should not mean that it is then OK to wholesale misreport vast numbers of deaths to get support for that health system. We should be able to deal with overloaded ICUs just as well with the true risk being stated, as with a vastly over-sensationalised risk to the public like we have now. Without realising it, society has begun a negotiation between:

* ICU workers, the frail, and the sensationalist media who can profit from their heroism, dramatic scenes, and overstated deaths
* those at the bottom of the economic ladder, their dependants, and those that we may now push there, who get screwed in economic collapses, suffer/die miserably out of sight, out of the sensationalist media well before their time, with no palliative care, other than their self medication.

If we get this - whole - calculation wrong, based on misrepresentations of the truth, rather than the actual truth, this will lead to more deaths than necessary - *as happened in Wuhan* \- where initially only the economic case for ""just carrying on"" prevailed in the misrepresentation of *that* evidence - when Wuhan could easily have afforded some downtime to sort out the virus - that *would* have maximised their public health, before they fixed their misrepresentation of the risk.

When only one side of this colossal negotiation is being heard, hyped in the media, or not heard at all, we are almost certainly making a bad situation worse.

Health systems are - and will - be overburdened by this. Even this happens from time to time outside of pandemics, and medical workers are probably fed up with no-one caring when it does happen, or when they are overworked. But should we flood the news with misleading stats giving a significant risk of a truly damaging overreaction? An overreaction that will now very likely mean we make a miscalculation, and lead to worse health effects for healthy, working age adults, from economic depression - which has no front line at all from which to report from?

The UK actually had a sensible ""herd immunity"" path, (which in practice it still has, but doesn't want to publicly admit as only the most panicked were being heard - it's now in the flatten the curve part of the herd immunity path truth be told) which, believe me, will be the path the USA will eventually find itself in, where the only thing stopping more transmission will be that most people have immunity - and was the only path available to any significantly globalised country - it's just a matter of how soon/hard to flatten, and how much damage to society is done in the economic downturn vs the damage to society from overloaded ICUs - the only thing currently being hyped up or mentioned almost at all. Societies like the UK and USA are so porous to other countries populations under globalisation that a border clampdown and aggressive testing, while keeping the economy going would never work like it did in South Korea, and seemingly Japan - these could blow up at any time too if their testing falls behind their outbreaks. Any globalised country with no access to anything less than regular, most-of-population testing that does not have herd immunity, will keep having to have lockdowns untill herd immunity is eventually present. But when the only voice being heard are the cries of ICU workers, misrepresentations of the deaths, or the odd healthy young person who dies suddenly in unexplained circumstances and happened to test positive from coronavirus, which happens outside pandemics too - when a majority in many countries now have it.... the a far more muted voice of those struggling with economic collapse may prove a much more costly voice to ignore (lessons from Wuhan) for public health, and the fabric of society.

A professor of risk at Bristol University in the UK has estimated that a 6.4% fall in GDP in the UK will cost 400,000 lives - the number currently expected to be saved from coronavirus due to the lockdown, guided by figures like that of Italy. Any higher a cost to GDP - may cost more lives than we save. I hope these lives we are paying for in the economic depression are worth it.

Lewis Carroll as metaphor for class struggle,"I was thinking last night: You know that poem from Lewis Carroll?  ""The time has come, the walrus said, to speak of many things..."" That one. Well here's this about that. That whole verse is a great metaphor for economic inequality and the needed pushback.

The walrus? Shorthand for the crux of the matter -- wal-r-us -- Wall Street or us?  The relentless pursuit of only unending gigantic profit at the cost of the misery of most of humanity, or us, and the pursuit of the wellbeing of almost everyone on earth instead.

""(of) Sailing ships and sealing wax"" -- Sailing ships, as in ""Social Democracy? That ship has sailed."" Or has it? 

Sealing wax, as used on royal decrees and proclamations, legislations, etc. It's where we get the expression ""their fate was sealed."" Is it?

""(of) Cabbages and kings"" -- Cabbages represent basic sustenance, the absolute staples of existence for ""common"" people.

Kings, like we don't have anymore, right? But of course we do, they just got us to call them something else, a less loaded term. Why do we allow them to rule? Divine right? Oh, please! 

""of why the sea is boiling hot, and whether pigs have wings."" -- The average temperature of the sea is rising.

Pigs -- oligarchs, grifters, the 1%, the obscenely rich, hedge-fund greedheads -- you know, pigs.

Congrats,"Well done, you did it.

It may have taken everyone else in the party, including Liz, but well done you won the nomination. Joe Biden will be the democratic nominee!

However, it's not over. You've still got a few \*small\* things left to do:

1. You've got to convince the country that voted against Clinton 4 years ago that someone running on the same policies should be president. But this may be easy. Trump is really fucking up Coronavirus so you've got a shot!
2. You've got to convince at least some of the 'Bernie Bros' that make up approximately 30% of your party that they should vote for Biden. Its gonna be hard to convince this lot though. These people were called bullies, commies, sexists, racists.... and a host of other names by people supporting Biden, so this may be hard. Luckily Trump is in the WH so saying 'lesser of two evils' might work. However if this doesn't work you still got a chance: The Bernie people are really only interested in policy, so maybe throw them a bone with 1 or 2 policies. M4A, Cannabis Legalisation, Criminal Justice Reform, Breaking up the big banks, Nationalisation of some industries or the Green New Deal are all possibilities.
3. After 4 years of saying 'I believe women', you've got to explain why 1 woman, Tara Reade, shouldn't be believed. Trump has many more accusers, but some people wont vote for anyone accused of sexual assault, irregardless of any 'lesser of evils' argument. This might be hard for you.
4. You’ve got explain why someone who clearly does not have a strong grip on reality should be president. Whether or not you want to admit it, Joe Biden clearly has lost a few marbles. The 'sleepy Joe' nickname is landing, so you’ve gotta think of a response quick!
5. The debates are not a kind prospect to Biden. Biden used to be a master debater, but his skill is definitely not what it used to be. Trump will look for a knockout punch against him, so he'll have to prep and prep, and hope he can get out without too many wounds. Not everyone likes Trump's style, but it is definitely effective.
6. There are a lot of apathetic Americans out there and you've gotta convince them that they should turn out for Biden. The numbers show that democrats win by increasing turnout and not by convincing republicans, so this also may be hard with a 'low energy' candidate like Biden.
7. Finally, you've got to deal with Biden's past. This was a killer for Clinton, from TPP to Iraq, Trump attacked her record endlessly. How are you going to deal with this.

Anyway there are a few more problems, fund-raising comes to mind and there are a couple of others that I can list below if you lot are interested. Anyway once you've dealt with all these problems, you've then got to govern.

We're in the midst of one of the biggest crises of the last 40 years, and the same old economic policy may not work. The market does not seem to be coping well, and proposed Keynesian policy may have to be implemented, although these policies also have big problems, and will be hard to get through.

My Vote for Elizabeth Warren,"Last Saturday, I took advantage of early voting for the 2020 Primary for a Super Tuesday state. After much thought and deliberation, I cast my ballot for Elizabeth Warren.  There were several excellent candidates, and I will vow to support anyone of them in the fall.  But in the end, I decided that Senator Warren would make the best President from the Democratic field.

Time and time again, she has shown the be the smartest person on the stage.  She has offered more than just ideas, but detailed plans and a realistic approach to how to achieve them.  But it is more than that.  She demonstrates an empathy with the American people, that she understands what we are going through.  She can turn almost any debate point into a story about people on the street.  On Main Street that is.  She has taken on Wall Street by leading the charge for the Consumer Protection Bureau.  Warren is a planner.  She’s the person that could tackle rising health care costs, education costs and have a plan to get to the end.  She is who I would want to lead the US during a potential public health crisis like COVID-19 or during hurricane season or, well, any kind of crisis.  Let’s make the Presidency competent again.  

Of the one million debates thus far, she has consistently been one of the best performers.  Probably the winner of 90% of them.  In taking down Mike Bloomberg, she showed that she was a fighter ruthlessly demolishing an out-of-touch billionaire.  You may remember that she also destroyed John Delaney before he even got off the ground with “I don’t understand why anybody goes to all the trouble of running for president of the United States just to talk about what we really can’t do and shouldn’t fight for.”  I could easily see her on the debate stage against Trump and utterly demolish him.  She, better than anyone, could attack Trump’s corruption and cruelty on the debate stage, leaving him with only a racial epithet as a rebuttal.

Before casting my vote, I debated with myself who I should pick.  I struggled to choose because they were all good in some way.  We all worry about the “electability” issue.  I took some quizzes like the WaPo and isidewith.com.  My answers generally aligned with Mayor Pete and Amy Klobachar more than Warren. But I was within 4% of most candidates.  So there has to be something else more than just agreeing on a quiz.  A Presidential election is a job interview.  A feeling that this is the person for the job. I like Senator Klobachar, but she just never really got off the ground.  But my choice really came down to Warren vs Pete. I hovered over both ovals for longer than I expected.  When it came down to it, I may like Pete but he doesn’t have the resume for me quite yet.  I hope he runs for Governor or Senator for his state and can turn this into a larger platform.  But his time isn’t now.  Maybe 2024 or 2028.  But for 2020, I came to select Elizabeth Warren. 

For the other candidates, they are all fine and good and would make a far better President than the current office holder.  I had wished Booker and Harris could have stuck around longer.  Booker just never really caught on in this cycle. And while Harris made a splash early on, she seemed to always have to walk back her remarks in the debates.  But had Harris made it to Super Tuesday, I think I could have had an even more difficult decision between the three. 

In the end, make sure your voice is heard.  You don’t have to write a page about who you picked an why. But speak with your vote.

This article points out some of the most infuriating things that could possibly be used in defense of Trump. The author, Sean Collins, has significantly downplayed the severity of the coronavirus and is succeeding at his job: to attract republican views. Things in the article like this:

“For example, US diplomat **Mick Mulvaney** — who at the time was the acting White House chief of staff — told attendees, **“The reason you’re seeing so much attention to [the coronavirus] today is that [Democrats] think this is going to be what brings down the president. That’s what this is all about.**””-Sean Collins, Vox. 

Collins then goes on to praise the president for being extraordinarily sanitary. 

“That Cruz, Gosar, and Collins had concerning contact at CPAC is striking considering many of the conference’s speakers worked to, as President Donald Trump has done, minimize the seriousness of the virus.” -Sean Collins, Vox. 

Mind you, this is *after* Trump publicly kissed a flag that has definitely been handled by many other people. The fact that it’s next to the president at all means that it has never once been dropped on the ground. Which, of course, means it’s been held carefully. 

The right wing is being influenced into paranoia about the left wing of the US wanting the virus to kill the president. While the left may *want* Trump to pass away, the argument made by Mulvaney is igniting unnecessary hatred, as I consistently see posts from the NYTimes and other more-liberal sources saying things about obtaining masks AND even asking themselves within the headline if a mask *can* help. The left doesn’t want anybody to get sick. We all know that but the right doesn’t. 

Now, personally, after my nearby hospital, John Muir, sent out an email saying they will no longer take walk-ins and will be doing over-the-phone screenings, I’m going to start carrying hand sanitizer for myself and using rubber gloves at the gas station. (I already do, I just wanted to make it sound easy so you’ll do it too.) **That doesn’t mean I want the virus to KILL the PRESIDENT.** 

Sidebar: Try to not touch your face without using soap first, and
#if you have to cough, cough in your ELBOW. Not your hand. 

I added that paragraph to help emphasize this one. There must be media that is shown exclusively to the right wing through data tracking. There must be, right? An entire wing of US politics can not be this oblivious without an external influences, right? Somewhere, someone, is making money by doing this to us. 

How can a publisher just write an article capable of turning America against itself, during the panic of a pandemic? It’s absolutely disgusting, if not treasonous, for pushing us closer and closer to our second Civil War.

Listen everybody, I don’t want your upvotes, I don’t want to hear why Sean Collins is innocent, I just want you to repost the article. Something fishy is going on with our media and I’m not fighting a civil war over Donald and COVID-19.

Now, personally, after my nearby hospital, John Muir, sent out an email saying they will no longer take walk-ins and will be doing over-the-phone screenings, I’m going to start carrying hand sanitizer for myself and using rubber gloves at the gas station. (I already do, I just wanted to make it sound easy so you’ll do it too.) **That doesn’t mean I want the virus to KILL the PRESIDENT.** 

Sidebar: Try to not touch your face without using soap first, and
#if you have to cough, cough in your ELBOW. Not your hand. 

I added that paragraph to help emphasize this one. There must be media that is shown exclusively to the right wing through data tracking. There must be, right? An entire wing of US politics can not be this oblivious without an external influences, right? Somewhere, someone, is making money by doing this to us. 

How can a publisher just write an article capable of turning America against itself, during the panic of a pandemic? It’s absolutely disgusting, if not treasonous, for pushing us closer and closer to our second Civil War.

Listen everybody, I don’t want your upvotes, I don’t want to hear why Sean Collins is innocent, I just want you to repost the article. Something fishy is going on with our media and I’m not fighting a civil war over Donald and COVID-19. If we share this enough, the right wing will see the truth and may even show us proof that this wild theory is true. That someone is messing with our media exposure.",3471,200,3270,8.152198015861787,1
I Feel Like I Need to Say This Out Loud,"So here's the thing.  I'm a huge Elvis Fan.  The day i found out that he died before I was born, I literally cried.

I genuinely feel for Trump, bc he has been brought up by a family of grifters who believe if you're not rich and perfect, you're nothing.

Thinking of leaving my party,"
I have been a lifelong republican (donated to Bush and Trump and you can check my post history) a few months ago I lost my job and got behind on some bills and had to live off credit cards but continued to pay the minimums because my credit has always been important to me and I knew I would want to buy a house in the near future. I now have a great job but need around 3k payed down to get approved for a home for my wife and children. I owe around 5k for ALL my debt and can’t get a loan for the 3k because it will run my credit and having a fresh account will drop my score and mess up my debt to income ratio. I started a go fund me to help pay my debt off (yes it’s my debt and I shouldn’t ask for help and I NEVER EVER HAVE) but I figured there would be some kind people to help me as I’ve always helped others. I posted it on a few pages I frequent and I received all kinds of backlash, being called lazy, a bum, told to get another job etc. I’ve never been so disappointed in my party. My mind is blown as I figured I had a lot of the same thoughts as other Republicans. I have always helped others and my dream has always been to have a home for my family. I will probably leave the party after this, I’ve never been treated this way. If this is how the republicans treat people in their party who need a little help I want no part of it.

Anyway with all this talk of the coronavirus going around i wanted to say something i heard at a convention the other day. My dad was talking with some people and they said that coronavirus was caused by increasing temperatures in the atmosphere. So i thought maybe this current global crisis was caused by global warming? It would make sense why the world governments are trying to cover it all up. China has kept it under wraps for ages and no wonder. They are the biggest producers carbon dioxide in the world!!

Fighting the metaphorical virus (hysteria) will help defeat the literal one.,"The fight that's getting all the attention is the one most of us have little control over, beyond a few basic preventative steps, but the one with the greater potential for long-term damage is something each of us can fight: Irrational fear...and its deformed child, blind obedience.

Trust in the views of people dedicated to science rather than those in politics, and be aware of the context of media coverage: They collaborate with ruthless political elements to compete for your fear, **not your understanding**.  

Defeating a virus is a matter of time.  Defeating the sort of people who would exploit a virus to demolish democratic institutions and human rights is a matter of attention, intelligence, and will.

In the (inevitable) event that malicious people ignore science and abuse health powers to attack our lives and societies, keep it in your back pocket that it will be up to you to refuse when that day comes.

Given who is in control, there is almost no chance that these extraordinary powers will be surrendered willingly, so don't delude yourself that there will be any voluntary return to normality.  And more importantly, don't count on the media or cowardly politicians to tell you when the day to exercise your own judgment has arrived.

Why as a Progressive Democrat I don't think Biden is Hillary 2.0 and can potentially win in November,"So I'll be honest, during the primaries I will vote for Bernie Sanders even tho it's pretty clear Biden will win nomination. 

Now I know my a lot of other progressives like Kyle Kulinsky and Jimmy Dore view this election as a lost cause since they view Biden as Hillary 2.0. heck even some of non-political friends think Biden is Hillary 2.0 and won't win election. 

They often state how Trump will destroy Biden in the debates and for whatever reason claim his mind is deteriorating pointing to his word fumbles. As far as Biden sounding strange [here is an LA times article about verbal audibles that stutters use](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-03-19/joe-biden-stutter-speech)

As far as the debates are concerned I feel like everyone forgot how Trump did in the presidential debates himself back in 2016. The guy was nuts. Even during debates where he sounded sane to start it only lasted like 5 minutes before he went completely off the rails. They also seen to forget how Joe Biden did against Paul Ryan back in 2012.  

So I don't think he'll perform as poorly as people think he will. 

Back in the 2016 primaries the states typically labelled as the Blue wall and I'm going to focus on Midwest states.

Wisconsin Bernie won 57% 

Michigan Bernie barely won with 49.68

Illinois Hillary won 50.56% it was close Bernie got 48.61%

I mention those states cause in general election.  Trump won Michigan and Wisconsin. 

In 2020 Democratic Primaries. 

In Michigan Biden won 50% to Bernie's 34%

In Illinois Biden crushed at 59% to Bernie's  36%

According to 538 based on polls in Wisconsin Biden is set to win big again. 

Plus President Trump has made several missteps during his presidency. 

Declaring he is a nationalist: [here](https://youtu.be/sazitj4x6YI) 

As relates to current events: [this was something Trump did literally when he first got into office ](https://youtu.be/8wTCknfXJGs)

President Obama installed a Pandemic team for this very situation. Could that have stopped or radically contained what's happening now. I can't really say cause College Frat crowd like those in Hawaii and Florida are gonna be dumb and reckless but it may have alerted them to get more tests. 

Trump's action during this pandemic has been slow and awful and very inefficient. And now we are facing a recession and a possible potential depression (I'm not really sure if we will fall that much) 

And as far as Allan Lichtmans 13 keys I have 5 keys flipped against Trump. And Lichtmans says if it is 6 keys then the challenger. Wins. Depending on how next few weeks goes I may get 6.

End Statement:

The states a lot of key states that Hillary to Bernie in primaries then in general to Trump Biden has won most of them with some very handily.

What do make of the fact Trump has unequivocally improved healthcare and the lives of Americans?,"https://nypost.com/2019/09/21/five-smart-ways-trump-has-improved-our-health-care-system/

https://www.breitbart.com/health/2019/03/28/president-trump-achievements-on-health-care-more-choice-lower-prices-life-saving-drugs/

Here are the top ten.

1.    Lower premiums. After the Obama administration oversaw massive double- and triple-digit annual increases in the price of Obamacare, the Trump administration has succeeded in stabilizing prices, which have decreased for many plans — contrary to what many experts predicted. Obamacare is still too expensive, and its deductibles far too high, but Trump fulfilled his campaign promise in 2016 to stop the massive premium increases under the policy.

2.    Short-term plans. Obamacare eliminated many cheap, bare-bones, short-term health insurance plans favored by younger people, forcing them to pay huge premiums for coverage they did not need. Some of these plans are 80% cheaper than the cheapest Obamacare plan. President Trump signed an executive order, and promulgated new rules, that expand the length of these plans from three to 12 months, and allow them to be renewed for up to three years.

 3.   End to individual mandate. President Trump’s tax cut, signed into law in 2017, eliminated the requirement to purchase insurance — the most constitutionally objectionable part of Obamacare. That change saved individuals and families hundreds of dollars per year in IRS fines. And contrary to the predictions of critics, it did not result in the collapse of the system as a whole, as premiums dropped and more insurance providers participated in the system.

4.    Group health plans across state lines. President Trump took a crucial step toward fulfilling the Republican promise of allowing people to buy insurance across state lines by signing an executive order in October 2017 that opened the door to employers in the same industry to pool their employees into common Associated Health Plans (AHPs) in different states. The result would be cheaper and better coverage for workers within those industries.

5.    Choice for veterans. President Trump signed the VA MISSION Act in 2018, which passed with bipartisan support and expanded options for veterans to obtain health care in the private sector. Trump has also prioritized addressing backlogs within the Veterans Affairs system. His commitment to veterans and first responders is such that even left-wing comedian Jon Stewart acknowledged Trump was doing a good job for 9/11 responders.

6.    “Right to try.” In May 2018, President Trump signed the “Right to Try” Act, which allows patients in desperate need to try new, experimental drugs that had not yet been approved by regulators. The law allowed patients to approach manufacturers directly, and limited their liability in the event the drugs did not work as hoped. In addition, the administration focusing on streamlining new drug approvals at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

 7.   Drug price information. President Trump has presided over the largest decline in drug prices in 46 years, and is proposing measures to lower them even further. In his 2019 State of the Union address, for example, he proposed “requir[ing] drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs way down.” He also proposed eliminating kickbacks to the middlemen in the prescription drug industry.

8.    Opioids and fentanyl. The Obama administration failed to deal with the opioid epidemic, even declining to declare a national emergency to stop the proliferation of deadly fentanyl. In contrast, President Trump has made the fight against opioids and fentanyl a priority. His effort to build a barrier along the U.S.-Mexico border, and his administration’s tougher border enforcement, have also aimed to improve public health by stopping the drug flow.

 9.   Better administration. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office Wednesday that his administration is doing a better job of administering Obamacare than the Obama administration itself. One way it is doing so is through allowing the states greater flexibility in addressing their insurance markets ” rather than subscribing to the previous administration’s prescriptive one-size-fits-all approach,” wrote Medicare and Medicaid administrator Seema Verna.

 10.   Support for repeal. President Trump’s enduring commitment to repealing Obamacare and replacing it with a policy that actually works is crucial. The alternative is letting the government take over health care entirely, which Democrats are embracing in the “Medicare for All” policy — which would ban private insurance and limit access to experimental drugs, among other fatal flaws.

"Let’s talk about the current state of our party, please","We have a major problems that clearly need addressing

So I’m just one of 1 million other voices but I’m hoping enough of you read this—maybe someone that is a position to make a difference?

We clearly lost the last election to trump even though very few people were expecting that to happen.

I think one of the major problems was the fact that Hillary Clinton has little to no charisma, she’s more of the same, and didn’t inspire people to get out to the polls.

Now there’s clearly been a huge pushback from the Obama terms—Those leaning right really didnt like any of it, and it should’ve been obvious that there was going to be a big turnaround (perceived, not justified) after Obama’s second term was over.

But what concerns me most is the Democrats are still playing by the same book as they were four years ago—

None of the candidates are really all that inspiring and Sanders who should have gotten the nomination the last time around was cheated out of the nomination.

It seems to me like the only other candidate who might make some effectual changes Tulsi—but that’s an even longer shot.

The Republicans are clearly playing scorched earth tactics, and the Democrats in power clearly haven’t got the memo—We’re going to end up in an even worse position if this continues.

It might feel a little bit grainy but I think we need to dig deep, And fight them the same way they’ve been fighting us

I don’t mean to imply that the ends always justify the means but clearly we’ve seen what can happen if you let people use these incredibly dirty (but HIGHLY effective tactics) to further agendas that are objectively worse and worse for us

Even 15 years ago any mention of potential Russian involvement would’ve been a death sentence to any politicians career. It’s clearly obvious that Trump was not smart enough to be The mastermind of some Russian intelligence plan—But the fact that the Russians wanted him in power should be a red flag enough

I believe the old expression is “the enemy of my enemy is my friend”

Well, what about the friends of my enemy?

Everything from how we are governed, to social welfare programs, how we treat our citizens—It all matters so much. But the problem is the average person in their day-to-day life doesn’t think about those things. Even if they were this stuff is so utterly complicated it really takes a government to perform.

Not to be the paranoid prepper either, but the threat of nuclear war has not gone away. The USSR fell, But Russia has definitely come back in stride. 

It’s easy to forget these things while you’re playing on your iPhone but it’s not a stretch to say that in these matters the fate of the world is kind of in the balance.

Defeating Trump in November: Phase One," 

How to Turn Out the Blue Vote in November, Phase One. I've been trying to share this on as many lib sites as I can.  We can write all the postcards and send all the texts we want... but nothing is going to beat an honest conversation with someone you trust when it comes to getting out the vote.   


We can't have another four years of this guy in office... please share on as many lib sites/boards/subreddits/etc as you can.  Phase Two coming soon!

Anyways, here's what to do:

***Find out which of your friends is not a voter; I’ve been doing this by a simple, “friends of mine who don’t vote, why are you abstaining?” Be direct, but reasonable… don’t post about how Trump is sending us towards authoritarianism and one-party rule, even though he clearly is.  Once you get a few answers, send them a private message (or talk in real life… you can still do that!) respecting their outlook, but politely ask them to reconsider, voting blue of course.*** 

***To the ones that are receptive to this, send them to this link:*** [***https://votesaveamerica.com/***](https://votesaveamerica.com/)  ***It’s the best one-stop shopping I’ve found so far to register to vote, find your polling place, and find out about the Democratic candidates so far.  Check out the site yourself, and help walk them through if needed.*** 

 ***Add incentives to election day and celebrate!  Offer to drive to your local polling place together.  Go out for bowling, billiards, and/or booze afterwards (first round is on you)!  Do whatever you can to get your like-minded pals to turn the vote out this November and VOTE BLUE.*** 

***Imagine… if each one of us simply got two of our friends to vote blue in this upcoming election, our victory would be so crushing, so overwhelming that no amount of election interference or MAGA poll intimidation could deny our victory.  We can do this folks… but not if we don’t mobilize now. We can’t stand idly by and hope things get better… we must make the change.  Let’s make it happen.*** ",Liberal,KyussSun,0,1,2020-02-06,76,"Defeating Trump in November: Phase One

Someone tweets a pic of Jonathan Pie taking a selfie with far right showing how much the far right like him for caricaturing liberals. Pie’s writers use tweet to make a video caricaturing liberals.,"Jonathan Pie videos frequently contain attacks on liberals and feminists. As academics have pointed out, the recent rise in the far right has been driven by propaganda demonising the left and feminists.  So unsurprisingly the far right like him even though Pie is left wing and he sometimes attacks them too. The fact someone on the left says it makes their propaganda much stronger. 

However his writers, one of whom is Andrew Doyle, strenuously deny that the far right like their stuff and laugh about how absurd it is when anyone points it out and says they are helping liberals by teaching them how bad they are. So this [tweet](https://twitter.com/Influxpress/status/1071768928496599040) with the far right wanting selfies with Pie is really quite damning.

Iowa Caucus Discrepancy Analysis,"# Introduction

Been busy this weekend trying to make sense of all these reports of discrepancies in the results of the Iowa Caucus. I just finished double checking my models, and wanted to share it.

To start, quick introduction.

I am an engineer. I don't have a political science background, but I am a Data Scientist at NASA. You may also know me as the person behind the [Medicare for All Calculator](http://sandershealthcare2020.com)

# The Caucus Model

My challenge was this: Build a model that can take the Final counts per candidate, and calculate all discrepancies between the reported SDEs and what would be expected to be the actual SDEs.

Model (in Excel spreadsheet form): https://1drv.ms/x/s!Am_fv_2JmQAAgZh2QJJf1v9c30kNIw?e=MAOpIH

For those that want to play with it: Download it and look at each precinct on the Scenario tab.

I am working on making sure this can get in the right hands at the Iowa Democratic Party, and the relevant Campaigns, so if you know the contact that I need to reach out to, send me a private message.

# Model Details

## Assumptions:

1. Viability threshold is 0.25 for 2 delegates, 0.1666667 for 3 delegates, and 0.15 for 4+ delegates. That is multiplied by the total in Final Expression and rounded up.
2. Cannot perform an adjustment that causes a candidate to lose their only delegate, unless all other candidates only have 1 delegate.
3. When performing adjustment, if excess, you must remove delegate from candidate that was rounded up the most
4. When performing adjustment, if short, you must add delegate to candidate that was rounded down the most

## Unresolvable Model Parameter:

1. In ~15 cases that an adjustment is performed wrong, or an unviable candidate is given delegates, there can be coin flips that would needed to have been performed that the model doesn't resolve.

# Results

1. The model calculates the exact same result for 1667 of 1765 scenarios
2. The model detected 139 coin flips
3. 98 Precincts had discrepancies:
4. 51 of those were due to ""Incorrect candidate chosen during adjustment
5. 21 of those were due to ""Unviable candidate given delegates""
6. 14 of those were due to ""Incorrect rounding of candidates

In the end, these errors accounted for **Pete Buttigieg getting +2.10 extra SDEs, and Bernie Sanders being shorted -4.44 SDEs**. All other candidates were generally only +/- 1 SDE.

**Sanders wins Iowa Caucus by: 5.03 (0.23%) SDEs**


## The 18 most significant precinct errors impacting the 2 leaders were:

These account for 6.09 of the SDE error, the remaining errors roughly average each other out.

Counterpoints to the whole “Democrats are just as bad as Republicans” argument?,"So I was in a civil discussion with my dad about politics this weekend, discussing impeachment and the state of the Republican Party. My dad has always been a conservative Republican, although he has softened his viewpoints around some certain social issues in the past couple of years, I like to think because of some of my convincing and also the fact that I’m gay and he’s had to deal with that if he wants me in his life. Anyways, we like to talk about politics a lot. He doesn’t like Donald Trump personally and thinks Trump is an idiot, but when I’m trying to convince him for the sake of the country and my future to vote Trump out, he always resorts to muddying the waters and what I view as a false equivalency argument of a general “Democrats are just as bad as Republicans”. It’s an argument that drives me nuts because no matter what I say, he’s always pointing out incidences of malfeasance by Democrats as a counterargument, true or not, potentially changing the subject, and not focusing on the issue we are discussing at hand. 

For example, when discussing Trump’s impeachment, he tries to turn the discussion to Biden or to Bill Clinton’s impeachment as a counterpoint, instead of focusing on Trump’s actions and whether they’re right or wrong. I know this is a pretty common tactic, but I’m wondering if any of you have had success convincing family members to change their mind/vote on Trump, and what tactics you used to do so. I feel like I’m making headway with my father and since I know he doesn’t like Trump, I’m trying to figure out ways I can push him over the edge to change his mind.

Heather Mac Donald coming to Washington &amp; Lee the same day as Dennis and Judy Shepard,"The vocal conservative group, The Generals Redoubt, who has threatened W&amp;L students before, has invited this speaker who says students are being deluded by universities to think that they’re oppressed. She talks about “the campus rape myth” and the “war on cops,” ultimately spewing falsehoods and hate that goes against any diversity efforts attempted by W&amp;L. The same day, Dennis and Judy Shepard are having an open forum to discuss their efforts against hate crimes after the murder of their son, Matthew Shepard.

What are your thoughts on the theory that low-income Americans have been negatively and disproportionately affected by the rise of social liberalism?,"The decline in religiosity, and the concomitant collapse of church and other social institutions have undermined precisely the same people who have been hit hard by the economy.  Charles Murray pointed out this phenomenon in his book ""Coming Apart"" nearly a decade ago: America has bifurcated between more highly educated, higher-income Americans (Murray labels them residents of Belmont) and less educated, lower-income Americans (Murray labels them residents of Fishtown).  This holds true regardless of race. And contrary to popular opinion, those who are less educated and lower-income, particularly in the white community — the base of support for President Donald Trump — have been disproportionately affected by the excesses of social liberalism. Between 1960 and 2010, the marital rate among  highly educated, higher-income Americans ages 30 to 49 declined from 94% to 84%; the marital rate among Fishtown whites declined from 84% to 48%. Similarly, single motherhood increased from 1% of Belmont white college-educated women in 1970 to less than 6% in 2008; for Fishtown women, that number skyrocketed from 6% to 44%.   


 Most tellingly, secularism increased for both groups but far less among Fishtown residents (from about 29% in 1972-1976 surveys to 40% in 2006-2010 surveys) than Belmont residents (from 38% to 59%). In other words, the wages of social liberalism take a deeper toll on those who require more from social institutions, both economically and culturally. Denizens of The New York Times are far less likely to have children out of wedlock than the supposed religious fanatics they oppose — but they're also likely to push both governmental and social policy designed to promote single motherhood, for example. They don't pay the price of the policies they push.",Liberal,GhettoNeddo,28,1,2020-02-13,69,"What are your thoughts on the theory that low-income Americans have been negatively and disproportionately affected by the rise of social liberalism?

Winning the U.S. Senate and keeping the House in 2020 is more important for the Left than winning the presidency.,"I get it. Trump is bad, like, beyond terrible. I myself am a fan of Bernie Sanders and will definitely be voting for him in the primary, and of course I will vote for just about anyone in the general election.

That being said, we need to focus on something that has been stated time and time again the last three years: Trump is a symptom of the problem, not the root. The root is two-sided: The U.S. government is not as invulnerable to corruption as many people like to believe (which means the Constitution itself needs revision), and Republican lawmakers (note, I'm not targeting their voters) have been more than happy to take advantage of this corruptible nature.

For this reason, the Left should be investing way more resources in Congressional races. If the Left takes control of Congress, we can A) block Judicial appointments in the case of a Trump victory, B) began pushing through legislative ground work for Constitutional change (even if it's vetoed at the top), and C) impeach AND CONVICT those who must be held accountable.

Are there any liberal pro Israel groups?,"The older generation of liberals have more common sense when it comes to Israel. They understand that it was the Arabs that attacked first, slaughtering innocent woman and children throughout the early 1900’s. When the Israelis and the Palestinian Arabs were given their separate land in 1947 the Arabs refused and, along with a coalition of surrounding Arab countries, attacked Israel with the intent in destroying it. They lost that war and lost some of the land they had used to attack Israel. Still, Israel gave the Sinai back to Egypt, to keep the peace. Seems fair right? 
They tried again a year later, and lost. They tried again in 1967, using the tall hills of Judea and Samaria to bombard Israeli settlements. They had Israel out manned and out gunned, but not out smarted. Despite what the whole world bet would be Israel’s destruction, Israel pushed the Arab coalition back, forcing them to surrender, within 6 days. 
They made it all the way to Cairo in the West, Damascus in the north, and completely taking over Judea and Samaria. Over the next few decades Israel would wind up giving up 91% of the land they had gained for peace, even as large Palestinian Arab terrorist groups, calling for Israel’s destruction, committed horrific acts in of violence against innocent Israeli citizens. 
Arab leaders around the world still blatantly say they want to destroy Israel. If Israel had given back all of Judea and Samaria, they certainly would have been destroyed by now, given the kinds of weaponry available today. 
And now, after all the atrocities that have befallen them, they are now being smeared as “an apartheid state” or are “committing genocide”. This is all lies, stemming from a conspiracy of Arab leaders to spread disinformation to the west. The goal being a fully autonomous Arab Palestinian state controlling all of the West Bank, leaving Israel to their mercy. 
I already know the very title of this post is going to piss a lot of people off. And I’m going to get a lot of angry comments, but I don’t care. I’m as left as it gets and I believe supporting Israel and supporting Zionism is apart of that. 
For anyone with the patience to read this far a applaud you. 

Some quick responses to the comments I know I’m going to get: 

“Zionism is bad. It’s the Jews thinking they have a biblical right to all the land, so they’re literally taking over Arab territories and settling them” 
— Zionism (in the context of modern Jews) stems from a movement in the late 1890s-early 1900’s among Jewish leaders (see Theodore Herzl)  to establish a nation all Jewish people could retreat to for safety. This was a time when anti-semitism was on the rise and Jews were being massacred in Russia. 
Some of these Zionist leaders were in favor establishing Israel somewhere in Africa, or perhaps in the Americas. More were in favor of returning to their ancestral homeland.
There is nothing in any Zionist movement calling for an expansion of Israel. It is simply a movement to have a place where the Jewish people can go for safety. No more holocausts. 

“Israel is an apartheid state”
— Israel is the most diverse liberal democracy in the Middle East. They grant citizenship and voting rights to all people living within their border. Almost half the country is Arab, and they enjoy more rights than Arabs in Arab countries. The “West Bank” and Gaza Strip Arabs have decided to forego those rights and be a nation apart from Israel. They have their own STATE called PALESTINE. Unlike Israel, Palestine IS an apartheid state. In Israel there are at least a dozen Arabs that hold seats in the Israeli government. Care to guess how many Jews are in the Palestinian government? 

“Israel is committing mass genocide”
— this is an even more ignorant statement than the previous. There is literally no proof of any genocide going on in Israel. Again though, take a look at the surrounding nations and maybe you’ll find it curious why there are no more Jews. 

“Israeli soldiers kill innocent Palestinians”
— if somebody is threatening your life would just lie down your gun? The Palestinian injuries and deaths stem from those Palestinians attacking Israeli soldiers in large numbers. They throw rocks and roll burning tires at them. 
Israeli soldiers are commanded not to shoot at innocent civilians and to only shoot if their life is in danger. What would you do, if someone who wants to kill you and thinks your whole family and people should be massacred, were throwing big rocks at you, along with 50+ other people? 

“Netanyahu is corrupt” 
— Even if he is, so what? Is America bad bc Donald trump is the president? 

“The Palestinians are suffering” 
The Palestinians are suffering because of their culture of hate against Jews, Israel, and the West. Their leadership suppresses them, killing off any opposing voices instead of oh idk, an election. 

In short, there really is no easy answer to this. The Jewish people lived there first, for about 1500 years until the Romans, and eventually Muslims kicked most of them out. Arabs then started settling the area, especially Jerusalem for the next thousand years however some Jewish communities would remain. 
Under the Arabs the land became desolate and barren, mostly populated by nomadic Bedouins and crumbling ancients towns. 
When the Jewish people were given back control over the land, they took pride in it and brought it back to life. Where there was only desert just a hundred years ago is now filled with forests and farms, magnificent cities and highways, and a bustling free people. 

These people are an enigma for the part of the world they live in. They’re a lot like you and me, but confined to country the size of New Jersey, surrounded by nations of millions who want to see them massacred. 
Still, they feel relatively safe, wake up in a bed and house similar to yours. In a neighborhood that could pass as an American suburb. Going to work or going to school. Paying bills and taxes. Having to wash the car once a week and remembering to pick up the dog shit every evening before it gets too dark. They vote. They can wear whatever clothes they want to wear regardless of gender. They’re allowed to be socialists or atheists or heck even practice witchcraft if they were so inclined. They can openly criticize their government and/or religion without government reprisal. They can form political parties and anyone can run for public office. 
These rights are not fully available to the citizens of any Arab state where in some, woman have their clitorises cut off, or atheist are burned at a stake, or women are stoned for wanting an education. These are not good people American liberals put so much support behind. They hold vile racist beliefs that aren’t just going to go away within a few generations.

How is a sub-reddit that bans you over one comment defending a union center-*left*?  Sounds like a right-wing sub-reddit to me.

They even blocked me from messaging their mods to ask why I was banned over what I thought was one mainstream Democratic comment.  I don't even *know* it was that comment- they didn't say.  I assume it was that comment because it was my only recent comment there that I recall.

Some philosophy behind the frustration of a right wing cult of my family relatives.," 

Hello everyone so today i wanted to rant about something and kind of get it of my chest because it has really been stressful for me. I really have been struggling with my xenophobic uncles, since they always been hateful towards minorities and different races/ ethnicities and my uncles in the past have been saying that they wanted to burn all Albanians but they also naivly use Hitler to call anybody who doesn't agree with them in other trivial issues like when someone is more opinionated than them etc, so i assume they kind of go with the flow of society not really having any groud or basis for their beliefs / academic education or knowledge on the topic of politics just overall hatred, even for the LGBT community they used to harass people that wouldn't fit to that narative of macho man and feminine girl that they would debate their intelligence compared to male, and i live in Greece so for Greeks population in general there is usually an antagonization towards Albanians Turkey and immigrants in general, so i've been trying to avoid them since it has been really annoying in the past talking with them and bullying me for not looking man enough, so anyway because i've been estranging them they do find a way to message me on social media and send me these videos of their dearest politicians that they are indoctrinated into from their religious culture etc. So i do understand them but my uncle this time posted a video of a politician talking about evidence they have that they're paying for immigrants.

So im going to denotation of the sittuation and what i see here happening.

Initially they did discover that ""we are paying for the immigrants"" and they are suddenly all traumatised by it , second they react like they did recently realize that we have immigrants and now they are terrorized or petrified that we are having immigrants. So therefore im assuming that this is the incentive they have to blame and going through their individual lifes and experiences they can associate this with every difficulty, complexity , labour , struggling etc. So these politicians do advocate and appeal to the commoner's nationalist sensitivity and fear of immigration since over the 50% of the country right now is right leaning and my uncles right now have been more and more drawn to populist conspiracy theorist social circle and friends so i think this is probably the right time to disassociate myself from them completely",Liberal,pasdp0l43,6,1,2020-01-13,100,"Some philosophy behind the frustration of a right wing cult of my family relatives.

I’m 14 and Bernie is the only one that I feel I can trust with my future,"
Look, I know many will discount my opinion because of my age, and I understand that. However, this election will affect me more then anyone voting in it. 

Bernie is the only candidate with the conviction to stick to his guns and the understanding that compromise is needed to create real change. He is both the birth of a revolution and the man known for writing and passing an incredible amount of bills. He supported LGBT rights since it was radical, and he picket fenced the Vietnam war before pretending to condemn it was a sure way to gain polling numbers.

He will greatly improve quality of life of both the people entering and leaving our workforce, rather then the 1% that never needed to join it. I want to know that my college cannot send me into lifelong debt, my company cannot take away my right to healthcare, and if I am unlucky enough to get cancer I will not be forced into bankruptcy.

Not to mention the fact that even the high middle class will find that their wallets feel fuller.  Employers will not be able to hold healthcare over unions head, and the increase of taxes will be fractions of the current cost of healthcare. In addition, the cost of college and mission of relieving student debt will be payed for by Wall Street taxes, meaning that the only way it can affect you is the fact that your college funds will go from concerningly low to more then enough.

And to those who think M4A is unrealistic, it has been put into affect, it exists in 32 of 33 developed countries, and I bet you can guess who the one is.

"Question, am I oversimplifying this, or is Elizabeth Warren's Wealth Tax as Ludicrous as it seems?","So this is her website page describing her policy: [https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/ultra-millionaire-tax](https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/ultra-millionaire-tax)

I'll quote the pertinent paragraph:

&gt;That’s why we need a tax on wealth. The Ultra-Millionaire Tax taxes the wealth of the richest Americans. It applies only to households with a net worth of $50 million or more—roughly the wealthiest 75,000 households, or the top 0.1%. Households would pay an annual 2% tax on every dollar of net worth above $50 million and a 6% tax on every dollar of net worth above $1 billion. Because wealth is so concentrated, **this small tax on roughly 75,000 households will bring in $3.75 trillion in revenue over a ten-year period.**

Alright, so in general, tax the ultra rich, spread it out to the poor and middle class - that's fine. However, when I get into the details of this plan, something just strikes me as absolutely nuts...

It is based off of net worth, and not income.

Now, this is really besides the point, but whatever net worth they've built up has already been taxed to some extent, either through capital gains or income tax. Just pointing that out as a principal; but it may very well be the case that tax havens and the like proves this wrong.

Anyway, to the main point: net worth doesn't mean someone is liquid. I'm just going to give an anecdote from my personal life to illustrate the problem I see with this. I met a friend in 4th grade. His father, around the 1990s, starting a water hydraulic manufacturing company. It started in earnest, and at present, makes about 22M a year in revenue. It's in a small town, provides for high skill labor jobs, such as CNC machinists, manufacturing line expediters, and mechanical engineers designing the products themselves. It's a nice piece of the community, creating opportunities for people who don't go to college, but want to learn a skill, with a reasonable payday, healthcare, and a 401k.

Now i'm not in finance (and please feel free to correct me if my following calculation is absurd) but given a rolling average of 18 - 22M in revenue of the last three years and less than 1M in debt, I'd say the company is worth about 45M if someone wanted to buy it outright. 

Well, obviously, the person that started this company decades ago has invested in rental homes to AirBnB out, bought an appreciating property for himself and his family to hang out at in the summers, etc. So he's right about on the fringe of the 50M threshold for Warren's bill. 

This guy is not liquid. He doesn't draw some million dollar salary from the company. He gives himself 100k - 200k based off of how the year went (there's been some bad years). This dude pretty much just leverages debt. He doesn't pay for these properties, he just uses a portion of the cash-flow of the business as collateral and makes mortgage payments.

Nevertheless, he is still technically around that 50M mark, but has very little liquidity to back him up. Elizabeth Warren's tax bill would essentially force him to divest and sell pieces of his company just to pay the taxes. You mite feel like ""well the guy lives a fine enough lifestyle,"" but if he were to do that, you no longer have a local running this business which has done so much good for the community. Who would buy the stake from him? Someone even richer? What are you going to end up with? Richer and richer people buying off the property of high net, low liquidity individuals - causing even more disparity and less localized priorities.

So, my question to everyone is this: am I somehow misinterpreting this, or is Elizabeth Warren's wealth tax really just going to lead to capital gains earning and million-dollar salary draining folk taking the property of business owners who pretty much embody a fair mid-market business owner persona? Is this not going to lead to less localized priorities for community businesses? Is this not going to simply create more wealth disparity? 

I know I gave an anecdote, but there are plenty of people who are worth 50M who aren't that liquid because they just own stuff, not siphon the liquid dollars for themselves.",Liberal,amayle1,0,1,2020-01-14,99,"Question, am I oversimplifying this, or is Elizabeth Warren's Wealth Tax as Ludicrous as it seems? So this is her website page describing her policy: [https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/ultra-millionaire-tax](https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/ultra-millionaire-tax)

I'll quote the pertinent paragraph:

&gt;That’s why we need a tax on wealth. The Ultra-Millionaire Tax taxes the wealth of the richest Americans. It applies only to households with a net worth of $50 million or more—roughly the wealthiest 75,000 households, or the top 0.1%. Households would pay an annual 2% tax on every dollar of net worth above $50 million and a 6% tax on every dollar of net worth above $1 billion. Because wealth is so concentrated, **this small tax on roughly 75,000 households will bring in $3.75 trillion in revenue over a ten-year period.**

Alright, so in general, tax the ultra rich, spread it out to the poor and middle class - that's fine. However, when I get into the details of this plan, something just strikes me as absolutely nuts...

It is based off of net worth, and not income.

Now, this is really besides the point, but whatever net worth they've built up has already been taxed to some extent, either through capital gains or income tax. Just pointing that out as a principal; but it may very well be the case that tax havens and the like proves this wrong.

Anyway, to the main point: net worth doesn't mean someone is liquid. I'm just going to give an anecdote from my personal life to illustrate the problem I see with this. I met a friend in 4th grade. His father, around the 1990s, starting a water hydraulic manufacturing company. It started in earnest, and at present, makes about 22M a year in revenue. It's in a small town, provides for high skill labor jobs, such as CNC machinists, manufacturing line expediters, and mechanical engineers designing the products themselves. It's a nice piece of the community, creating opportunities for people who don't go to college, but want to learn a skill, with a reasonable payday, healthcare, and a 401k.

Now i'm not in finance (and please feel free to correct me if my following calculation is absurd) but given a rolling average of 18 - 22M in revenue of the last three years and less than 1M in debt, I'd say the company is worth about 45M if someone wanted to buy it outright. 

Well, obviously, the person that started this company decades ago has invested in rental homes to AirBnB out, bought an appreciating property for himself and his family to hang out at in the summers, etc. So he's right about on the fringe of the 50M threshold for Warren's bill. 

This guy is not liquid. He doesn't draw some million dollar salary from the company. He gives himself 100k - 200k based off of how the year went (there's been some bad years). This dude pretty much just leverages debt. He doesn't pay for these properties, he just uses a portion of the cash-flow of the business as collateral and makes mortgage payments.

Nevertheless, he is still technically around that 50M mark, but has very little liquidity to back him up. Elizabeth Warren's tax bill would essentially force him to divest and sell pieces of his company just to pay the taxes. You mite feel like ""well the guy lives a fine enough lifestyle,"" but if he were to do that, you no longer have a local running this business which has done so much good for the community. Who would buy the stake from him? Someone even richer? What are you going to end up with?

How do you deal with so much hatred in USA? Is libertarianism going to be the winner in this long war?,"I am not from the USA but have been following the politics of the USA for the last 3 months. Sorry for so many questions, but I cannot sleep at night with so many doubts. Answer whatever you can. 

1. First, impeachment. HIC is investigating whether Trump has done anything wrong with Ukraine. But from what I am noticing, republican politicians and voters have been shouting ""Impeachment is a sham, you are not letting us do our work, do nothing democrats, etc."" If Trump gets acquitted in this impeachment process due to lack of evidence, he will get more popularity, (GOP knows he did something wrong, that is why they are blocking it), but why are voters supporting Trump still? Police have to do their investigations, even if the people think the accused didn't do the crime. Why do people believe it as an action by democrats to undo the 2016 election? 
2. I don't know exactly what ads are promoted during election campaigns. How much do the people believe about whatever is shared on facebook is correct? 
3. Stats show that the majority of the voters get their news from Fox news. Is it really true (public pulse)? If that is the case, it is the end of democracy. I don't think any president in recent times attacked 90% of the media, it was Hitler's time. It also reminds of churches burning scientific journals. Trump and GOP have actually convinced people that only Fox News is credible, isn't it? Is it a mob mentality or shouting the same thing again and again so that people actually believe the false is the truth? The republicans voters are not even listening to what democratic presidential candidates have to say. 
4. Do republicans fear everything? Fear of job losses, Fear of immigrants, fear of people (so stocking more guns make them feel safer) and so many. Conservative def. averse to change or innovation and holding traditional values. When the world is changing every second, how long will this stance of conservatism stand (50 years, 100 years)?

Thanks for the answers, be civil.",Liberal,raffaellosanzio,0,1,2019-11-25,149,"How do you deal with so much hatred in USA? Is libertarianism going to be the winner in this long war? I am not from the USA but have been following the politics of the USA for the last 3 months. Sorry for so many questions, but I cannot sleep at night with so many doubts. Answer whatever you can. 

1. First, impeachment. HIC is investigating whether Trump has done anything wrong with Ukraine. But from what I am noticing, republican politicians and voters have been shouting ""Impeachment is a sham, you are not letting us do our work, do nothing democrats, etc."" If Trump gets acquitted in this impeachment process due to lack of evidence, he will get more popularity, (GOP knows he did something wrong, that is why they are blocking it), but why are voters supporting Trump still? Police have to do their investigations, even if the people think the accused didn't do the crime. Why do people believe it as an action by democrats to undo the 2016 election? 
2. I don't know exactly what ads are promoted during election campaigns. How much do the people believe about whatever is shared on facebook is correct? 
3. Stats show that the majority of the voters get their news from Fox news. Is it really true (public pulse)? If that is the case, it is the end of democracy. I don't think any president in recent times attacked 90% of the media, it was Hitler's time. It also reminds of churches burning scientific journals. Trump and GOP have actually convinced people that only Fox News is credible, isn't it? Is it a mob mentality or shouting the same thing again and again so that people actually believe the false is the truth? The republicans voters are not even listening to what democratic presidential candidates have to say. 
4. Do republicans fear everything? Fear of job losses, Fear of immigrants, fear of people (so stocking more guns make them feel safer) and so many. Conservative def. averse to change or innovation and holding traditional values. When the world is changing every second, how long will this stance of conservatism stand (50 years, 100 years)? Is it doomed to die one day?

Letters from the front lines in the war on Thanksgiving - [compose yours here],"My dearest Mary,

I'm writing to you from the front lines of the War on Thanksgiving.

I know you did not want me to enlist, Mary, but I felt it was my duty to my country. I am just a humble, red-blooded, white, Christian, All-American male and I'd rather die than say ""Happy Fourth Week of November"" to someone.

I don't want to scare you, but I can say it with great honesty: This is a fearsome war, Mary. Unlike the war on Christmas, where we would march to the beat of our beloved Christmas carols like ""Silent Night"" and ""We Three Kings"", we are unable to find Thanksgiving-themed songs that weren't composed by godless liberals. Not even the Arlo Guthrie classic, ""Alice's Restaurant"" would be hummed. As a result, we sadly march in silence.

The other day, we were greeted with fresh coffee and donuts from supporters of our cause. We later realized it was but a facade when our black ""coffee"" was actually Pumpkin Spice Latte's,  and the donuts were gluten-free and sweetened with natural cane sugar. My friend, Zebulon is experiencing PTSD as a result. Fairtrade coffee be damned, Mary. Is there no end to how low the food-terrorists will sink? I think not. 

Worry not, Mary. This righteous war will soon be over, and after the stroke of midnight on Black Friday. I will join you early in the morning, as we wait in line at the Big Box store, to take advantage of doorbuster deals. This is our great American way.

All of my love, Roll Tide

I think that workplaces requiring a doctors note is a sensible idea that’s shifted in practice,"What I mean is, It seems very sensible to require that an employee both prove they were sick and prove they’re well enough to work again without getting others sick. I can’t argue the logic that it’s better to have a healthy workforce and to be sure about it. However, given the cost of healthcare and the way that the doctors note is required to even come back in combined with the corporate nature of a lot of jobs now, It makes it seem less like a sensible practice to protect employee health and more like a deterrent for employees to call in sick in the first place. 

I may be overthinking it here, but it seems to me that my job would rather me come in so they can send me home for not feeling well, as opposed to have me call them and tell them that.

My two cents on MS-13.,"I just saw a tweet from Trump about an MS13 raid in Staten Island, NY, and people are giving thanks to the president as if he was the person leading the raid, which is ridiculous to even think because it is literally just a gang raid. It doesn’t matter who holds the Oval Office, if there’s any dirt on gang members there will always be a task force chasing them down. Anyways, I’m glad they’ve been caught. They are harmful to normal people and if not at least really menacing and intimidating, it’s safer that they don’t go running free.

But that’s not what this post is about. It’s about the whole “MS13 members are animals” belief that people seem to denounce the “far-left” for “protecting savages”. Well, we’re not protecting anybody actually,  these are just facts. People pretend as if gangbangers aren’t made of blood, bone, muscle and skin, they are human just like the rest of us, and the image of MS13 is the embodiment of what happens when you decide to create such a dogshit environment for immigrants. It’s simple, hard places breed hard men. Calling people animals and doing gang-raids isn’t gonna fix the issue.

I grew up right in the center of LA, where lots of Hondurans, Salvadorans, and Central Americans moved a long time ago. First I want to reinforce the argument that MS13 began in America. Since it obviously did, and I know this because I literally grew up like 10-minutes away (walking) from where the 1st Mara click started. And wanna know the funny part? People use MS13 as one of the main demonstrations of what happens when immigrants keep flooding the border, and this is particularly hilarious because MS barely even has any territory anymore in LA. Other gangs like Wanderers, Crazy Riders (you probably haven’t even heard of these), and 18st control the same if not more hoods than MS does. I’ve seen more active tagging crews than MS13. 

Now I want to talk about the same thing that keeps being brought up over and over and over again in regards to MS. That their motto is “Rape, Steal, Kill, and Control”. This is literally the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. This may have originated from MS, but it’s not even proven that it has. This motto probably spread from gangland style documentaries. The fact that people believe this BS is enough evidence to me that middle-class Republicans have no idea what it’s like in the hood, hell, they’ve never even seen or had an altercation with any gang members and they’re over here talking like MS is a terrorist organization. 

Let me make this clear, MS isn’t even an organization, no gang is. Clicks of similar gangs aren’t connected, they may be friendly, but by no means would a gang member claim to be from two sets. It just doesn’t work like that. Taggers (aka mobbers) sometimes claim two crews, but gangs don’t do this.

 In terms of formality, cholos will wear their uniform (any type of shorts, sports jerseys, Nike shoes, socks pulled up high, hoodie) and that’s as far as it goes. They don’t live by a code, they don’t idolize that dumb motto. These guys lives are simple: never snitch,always bang on/press the enemy, never disrespect the set, drink modelos, smoke weed, and just kickback with the family. When a cholo intimidates a high schooler or whatever, it’s because they suspect him to be from another hood, or maybe because they are drunk and teasing random people. Of course there are members that are crazy and sick in head but that’s about less than 10% of them. Around 5% of MS affiliated members are the people committing those atrocious machete attacks.

We (the people) have a job to do,"While the president is impeached, I can't help but worry that many of us are claiming this as a victory too soon. My reasoning for this concern is simply because while Trump is a dumbass when it comes to running the country, he is powerful with his toxic rhetoric. The crap he spews is toxic in two ways; first and foremost he says what his base wants to hear in order to keep them loyal, angry and divisive towards us. The second way his voice is toxic is that it exhausts us, every time we hear his lies it wears us down, we wonder how long it will take until he's gone, but at the same time our motivation to stand up against him also drops.

We have a job to do. We cannot depend on presidential candidates and other politicians to tear away support from Trump and energize Democrats that have become too exhausted to even look at the news. It is our jobs, as neighbors of these Democrats and Republicans alike, to reach out to them and convince them that Trump needs to be taken down in every way possible.

With what I just said, I know many of you get intimidated by the thought if reaching out to Trump supporters, or Republicans in general, but let me explain why it is so important that we do this. People who are still loyal to Trump are only loyal because they are slaves to his rhetoric, they believe that he is Making America Great because he's saying that he is, but what are the facts? The fact is, while it may be extremely difficult to convince a red to become a blue, at the very least when we talk to our neighbors about how very little Trump actually cares about America, we may at least exhaust them like Trump has exhausted us. If we can exhaust enough of his base, he will lose significant support at the polls. If you know your neighbor well enough and know what they stand for tell them Donald doesn't stand with them. For example if you have a Christian neighbor who is pro life, talk to them about the many ways Trump has neglected children in his immigration and health care reforms, cite the recent Christian article supporting impeachment and Trumps many sins. 

Tl;Dr When it comes to Trump supporters, we need to talk to them in a way that may convince them that Trump isn't a godly being, he's a greedy, charismatic demon that manipulated America for personal gain. Talking to trump supporters may not net Democrats a lot of votes, but it will drop the amount of Republican ones.

(And when speaking with people who you disagree with dont yell or throw insults at them, because that just pushes them further away.)

Now as for how we speak to fellow democrats and independents who have been exhausted, the first thing we need to acknowledge is that they may be content with the fact that the president was impeached. The deed is done, we won right? Wrong. Tell them Trump isn't down yet. He has the power and the toxicity to win again if we stay content with the fact that he was impeached. We need to make sure those who are exhausted wake up in time for the elections. We need all the power we can get to take the big man in office down for good.

We (the people) have a job to do. We can tear this greedy tyrant off his throne and we can begin to heal the division and hatred that he sew into the country.",Liberal,buckster1014,0,1,2019-12-20,124,"We (the people) have a job to do While the president is impeached, I can't help but worry that many of us are claiming this as a victory too soon. My reasoning for this concern is simply because while Trump is a dumbass when it comes to running the country, he is powerful with his toxic rhetoric. The crap he spews is toxic in two ways; first and foremost he says what his base wants to hear in order to keep them loyal, angry and divisive towards us. The second way his voice is toxic is that it exhausts us, every time we hear his lies it wears us down, we wonder how long it will take until he's gone, but at the same time our motivation to stand up against him also drops.

We have a job to do. We cannot depend on presidential candidates and other politicians to tear away support from Trump and energize Democrats that have become too exhausted to even look at the news. It is our jobs, as neighbors of these Democrats and Republicans alike, to reach out to them and convince them that Trump needs to be taken down in every way possible.

With what I just said, I know many of you get intimidated by the thought if reaching out to Trump supporters, or Republicans in general, but let me explain why it is so important that we do this. People who are still loyal to Trump are only loyal because they are slaves to his rhetoric, they believe that he is Making America Great because he's saying that he is, but what are the facts? The fact is, while it may be extremely difficult to convince a red to become a blue, at the very least when we talk to our neighbors about how very little Trump actually cares about America, we may at least exhaust them like Trump has exhausted us. If we can exhaust enough of his base, he will lose significant support at the polls. If you know your neighbor well enough and know what they stand for tell them Donald doesn't stand with them. For example if you have a Christian neighbor who is pro life, talk to them about the many ways Trump has neglected children in his immigration and health care reforms, cite the recent Christian article supporting impeachment and Trumps many sins.

Trump also plans to sign other bills that will add be if it’s and revenue to our growing little company.

A Call To Arms," 

Sunday July 26th 2020. Mark that day in your calendars. That is ADA Awareness Day and the date selected for a March For Disability Rights. Due to the nature of our community, it is not feasible for everyone to march in DC, so I am calling for volunteers to organize your city for a coordinated march across America. Just how do you do that? Well, this is my first time too, but I have ideas on that. Look of the list of potential contacts to help you along.

Center for Independent Living: an organization dedicated to helping mobility disabled become independent

Political Parties

Any agency dealing with disability and/or disease.

Local media. Most media would love to get this story. The free advertising can attract additional people to march in solidarity.

College Greeks: Fraternities and sororities need social events to participate in.

Your local representatives at city, state and federal levels

Organizers should be prepared to be interviewed by local and/or national media

.

So what are we marching for? Improvements on the ADA particularly on enforcement. Better clarification on what constitutes “reasonable” accommodations. A Bill of Rights like every other minority. We want to be heard in the design of an universal health care bill, as we have special needs that must be addressed. Universal loan forgiveness for the disabled that doesn't require jumping through hoops. Most of all, a livable income. SSI has not kept up with inflation. Section 8 has not kept up with inflation. We are tired of just existing. I dare say, none of us ASKED to become disabled. We deserve the same respect the able bodied get and not looked at with contempt. Lastly, we are sick and tired of being the primary target whenever legislators start trimming the budget and we demand permanent protections written into law.

This protest is just beginning, so if you have anything you would like to be included, by all means speak up. You will never get the change you seek by remaining quiet. We must let America know we are here, we are never leaving and we want equal treatment under the law. I would like to suggest legislators create a counsel of like minded individuals to speak on behalf of our community and provide suggestions for what to include in legislation and new programs that would benefit us. Do I have any heroes to promote our cause? If you are on any other social network site, please spread the word.",Liberal,IdaCrackersGhost,2,1,2019-10-29,176,"A Call To Arms

Question regarding gun laws from a non-American,"Hello, 

I have a question for democrats in America regarding the gun laws. I come from Switzerland which has relatively liberal gun laws (even when compared to states such as California, New York, etc) and one of the lowest overall and *gun* murder rates. For instance, our gun murder rate ranks below that of Australia which is perhaps cited the most of any nation in this debate and has very stringent legislation.

Now when compared to most US states, our laws are substantially more stricter. However when compared to California and such, our laws are actually more lenient. For instance we do not have an ""assault weapon"" or magazine capacity ban.
My question is if Democrats would support an adoption of Swiss laws nationwide under two conditions:
No state is allowed to have stricter laws than the federal ones. That means states like Cali, NJ, etc aren't allowed to pass AWBs.
A constitutional amendment that stipulates any further tightening of the law requires two-thirds of the populace and states to agree (same as my country.)

### Gubernatorial Elections

* [Kentucky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Kentucky_gubernatorial_election): One-term Republican Matt Bevin is seeking re-election. In the May 21 primaries, Bevin held off three opponents to win the Republican primary. He will face Attorney General Andy Beshear, who defeated two challengers in the Democratic primary. The latest poll from Mason-Dixon Polling &amp; Strategy has the two candidates in a dead heat.
* [Mississippi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Mississippi_gubernatorial_election): Faced with an open seat due to current Gov. Phil Bryant’s term limits, Democrats could potentially stage an upset in this historically Republican state. While Mississippi hasn’t elected a Democrat to the role since 1999, the two state officials competing for the seat — Attorney General Jim Hood (D) and Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves (R) — are within striking distance of one another. 

### Legislative Elections

* [Virginia General Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_General_Assembly): Republicans control the House of Delegates with 51 seats to Democrats' 48, and the state Senate with 20 seats to Democrats' 19, with one vacancy in each chamber. All 140 seats are on the ballot Tuesday. Republicans have not won a statewide race since 2009, but they have held on to both the Senate since 2014 and House since 1999 by slim margins. Democrats are within striking distance of taking either chamber. If they were to win both, this would position the party to control the next round of redistricting ahead of the 2020 census.
* Legislative elections will be held for both houses of the [Louisiana Legislature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Legislature), the [Mississippi Legislature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_Legislature), and the lower house of the [New Jersey Legislature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Legislature).  

### Mayoral Elections

* [San Francisco, CA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_San_Francisco_mayoral_election): London Breed, the first African American woman the city has elected for mayor, is now running for a full term.
* [South Bend, IN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_South_Bend,_Indiana_mayoral_election): Democratic presidential candidate Mayor Pete Buttigieg won’t be running for reelection but he’s endorsed his former chief of staff James Mueller. Mueller is the favorite in a race against public school teacher and Republican candidate Sean Haas.
* [Philadelphia, PA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Philadelphia_mayoral_election): Kenney is running on raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour, maintain supervised injection sites and the city's soda tax, and ensure the city's compliance with the Paris Climate Agreement. Ciancaglini promises to end Philadelphia's status as a sanctuary city and to cancel plans to establish sites where people can legally inject heroin. No Republican has won a Philadelphia mayoral election since Bernard Samuel in 1947

### Ballot Measures

* [Washington State](https://ballotpedia.org/Washington_elections,_2019): The use of affirmative action in Washington state as it relates to government jobs and state universities has been barred since 1998, when voters approved a measure banning it. This year, voters will have the option to reinstate affirmative action.
* [New York City, NY](https://ballotpedia.org/City_elections_in_New_York,_New_York_(2019)): A ballot initiative asks voters whether they’d like to use ranked-choice voting in races such as the mayor’s election and the city council race. If the initiative passes, it would bring ranked-choice voting to the most populous city in the country, a huge step for pro-ranked-choice reform efforts.

Liberalism and leftism,"I pretty much never make a post on reddit, but this time I just have to. I follow r/politics and other news places very actively and they are just incredibly leftist - I've seen people defend antifa and call for murders on a lot of people. 

Sadly nowadays when someone says I'm a liberal they instantly assume you're a leftist. I would say there is a huge distinction between a leftist and a liberal. I myself would consider to be a liberal even though I have some conservative views on some stuff, but I'm still 100% willing to give up those conservative views in exchange for something better; don't think any conservative wouldn't. 

So if you're a liberal, please disassociate yourself from leftists. Leftist ideologies are horrific and should never be implemented in any society ever again, we have quite concrete evidence of why this should be the case.

#WNTT - We Need To Talk,"Hello y'all,

we need to talk. Being respectful and engaging in good faith are guidlines of this subreddit. Sometimes it is easy forget how important this is, regardless of a situation you are in. People can be really mean, people can hold horrible believes and people WILL upset you. But just like you, they are human. We are all humans with true sorrows, fears, wishes and the desire to be happy. You should never forget that.  

It is very easy to see flaws in others but very hard to see the own. Everytime you might be confronted with a different view, it is a huge challenge. A challenge you can win by seeing the good in others and seeing the flaws in your own. There is a huge lesson to learn. The left movement Sanders is representing can't deliver satisfactorily answers to every question that is asked. Not to mention that there rarely is one answer to them. That's okay but needs to be accepted.  

The right has won over many because people can't contain mindfulness regardless of which views they stand for.

It isn't the first time that [videos like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/daxnsx/protestor_wishes_rape_on_a_reporter_for_having/) go viral..

"For liberals, what is your economic basis for justifying your belief system?","Hi everyone. I have a legitimate question for liberals. 

First off, for full disclosure I'm not a liberal. My beliefs are Marxist but I'm interested in seeing your perspective out of curiosity.

For some background, when I was younger I toyed around with some Libertarian beliefs and briefly transitioned through liberalism before settling on Marxism and socialism.

The main reason for this was that I felt there wasn't an economic basis or theory backing up the liberal ideology (American liberals by the way) and Marx's arguments were much stronger than any of the Libertarian and right wing arguments. 

So in short, what are the arguments (economic or philosophical) that justify the American liberal ideological perspective? How do they differ from right wing Republican beliefs and/or theories? Is there any reading recommendations that would better articulate liberal economic theory?

List Of Progressives Running For 2020 Congress(Update 8-31-19),"Spread The Word:

I'm here with a list of candidates to raise attention on their races. I'm only here to help. If this is wrong in anyway to post, I apologize. So, don't only support Bernie Sanders. It'll help if we elect people like him to the two chambers of Congress. I've managed to gather a group of progressives we can help get into Congress. I'll also be adding open seats in case there is interest in the progressive movement to get a candidate to run for that race. Let's support these other progressives for House &amp; Senate as well if you can:

Political activist and presidential candidate's team attacked by police while protesting Straight Pride,"Yesterday, August 31st in 2019, in Boston, Massachusetts, notable political satirist and presidential candidate Vermin Supreme's team was harassed by police escort while protesting Straight Pride. Rod Webber, documentarian and activist, was livestreaming the event, and police requested he stop and turn away. After complying with orders, Webber was unceremoniously piled on by at least ten officers, and arrested. Webber reported being in so much pain that it was difficult to stand.

Radio Freedom on Kickstarter,"*Radio Freedom* is a compilation album, featuring twenty political/protest songs in all styles of music: metal, folk, hip hop, and more.

The long-term aim of the project is to establish a worker-owned, for-profit record label.

Politically-aware  musicians often have two choices: make money for a  company that goes  against everything they believe in, or go 'DIY' and  live in poverty.

Musicians shouldn't have to choose between making a difference and making a living.

The musicians on *Radio Freedom* will get a percentage which is well over the industry norm.

The funding goal represents the cost of mastering the songs, pressing the CDs, shipping, and Kickstarter fees.

The CDs will be manufactured by Austep Music, an environmentally-friendly music printing company.

Combat Liberalism,"We stand for active ideological struggle because it is the weapon for ensuring unity within the Party and the revolutionary organizations in the interest of our fight. Every Communist and revolutionary should take up this weapon.

But liberalism rejects ideological struggle and stands for unprincipled peace, thus giving rise to a decadent, Philistine attitude and bringing about political degeneration in certain units and individuals in the Party and the revolutionary organizations.

Liberalism manifests itself in various ways.

To let things slide for the sake of peace and friendship when a person has clearly gone wrong, and refrain from principled argument because he is an old acquaintance, a fellow townsman, a schoolmate, a close friend, a loved one, an old colleague or old subordinate. Or to touch on the matter lightly instead of going into it thoroughly, so as to keep on good terms. The result is that both the organization and the individual are harmed. This is one type of liberalism.

To indulge in irresponsible criticism in private instead of actively putting forward one's suggestions to the organization. To say nothing to people to their faces but to gossip behind their backs, or to say nothing at a meeting but to gossip afterwards. To show no regard at all for the principles of collective life but to follow one's own inclination. This is a second type.

To let things drift if they do not affect one personally; to say as little as possible while knowing perfectly well what is wrong, to be worldly wise and play safe and seek only to avoid blame. This is a third type.

Not to obey orders but to give pride of place to one's own opinions. To demand special consideration from the organization but to reject its discipline. This is a fourth type.

To indulge in personal attacks, pick quarrels, vent personal spite or seek revenge instead of entering into an argument and struggling against incorrect views for the sake of unity or progress or getting the work done properly. This is a fifth type.

To hear incorrect views without rebutting them and even to hear counter-revolutionary remarks without reporting them, but instead to take them calmly as if nothing had happened. This is a sixth type.

To be among the masses and fail to conduct propaganda and agitation or speak at meetings or conduct investigations and inquiries among them, and instead to be indifferent to them and show no concern for their well-being, forgetting that one is a Communist and behaving as if one were an ordinary non-Communist. This is a seventh type.

To see someone harming the interests of the masses and yet not feel indignant, or dissuade or stop him or reason with him, but to allow him to continue. This is an eighth type.

To work half-heartedly without a definite plan or direction; to work perfunctorily and muddle along--""So long as one remains a monk, one goes on tolling the bell."" This is a ninth type.

To regard oneself as having rendered great service to the revolution, to pride oneself on being a veteran, to disdain minor assignments while being quite unequal to major tasks, to be slipshod in work and slack in study. This is a tenth type.

To be aware of one's own mistakes and yet make no attempt to correct them, taking a liberal attitude towards oneself. This is an eleventh type.

We could name more. But these eleven are the principal types.

They are all manifestations of liberalism.

Liberalism is extremely harmful in a revolutionary collective. It is a corrosive which eats away unity, undermines cohesion, causes apathy and creates dissension. It robs the revolutionary ranks of compact organization and strict discipline, prevents policies from being carried through and alienates the Party organizations from the masses which the Party leads. It is an extremely bad tendency.

Liberalism stems from petty-bourgeois selfishness, it places personal interests first and the interests of the revolution second, and this gives rise to ideological, political and organizational liberalism.

People who are liberals look upon the principles of Marxism as abstract dogma. They approve of Marxism, but are not prepared to practice it or to practice it in full; they are not prepared to replace their liberalism by Marxism. These people have their Marxism, but they have their liberalism as well--they talk Marxism but practice liberalism; they apply Marxism to others but liberalism to themselves. They keep both kinds of goods in stock and find a use for each. This is how the minds of certain people work.

Liberalism is a manifestation of opportunism and conflicts fundamentally with Marxism. It is negative and objectively has the effect of helping the enemy; that is why the enemy welcomes its preservation in our midst. Such being its nature, there should be no place for it in the ranks of the revolution.

We must use Marxism, which is positive in spirit, to overcome liberalism, which is negative. A Communist should have largeness of mind and he should be staunch and active, looking upon the interests of the revolution as his very life and subordinating his personal interests to those of the revolution; always and everywhere he should adhere to principle and wage a tireless struggle against all incorrect ideas and actions, so as to consolidate the collective life of the Party and strengthen the ties between the Party and the masses; he should be more concerned about the Party and the masses than about any private person, and more concerned about others than about himself. Only thus can he be considered a Communist.

All loyal, honest, active and upright Communists must unite to oppose the liberal tendencies shown by certain people among us, and set them on the right path. This is one of the tasks on our ideological front.",Liberal,That_Rate,8,0,2019-09-06,229,"Combat Liberalism We stand for active ideological struggle because it is the weapon for ensuring unity within the Party and the revolutionary organizations in the interest of our fight.

List Of Progressives Running For 2020 Congress(Update 9-10-19),"Spread The Word:

I'm here with a list of candidates to raise attention on their races. I'm only here to help. If this is wrong in anyway to post, I apologize. So, don't only support Bernie Sanders. It'll help if we elect people like him to the two chambers of Congress. I've managed to gather a group of progressives we can help get into Congress. I'll also be adding open seats in case there is interest in the progressive movement to get a candidate to run for that race. Let's support these other progressives for House &amp; Senate as well if you can:

I'm here with a list of candidates to raise attention on their races. I'm only here to help. If this is wrong in anyway to post, I apologize. So, don't only support Bernie Sanders. It'll help if we elect people like him to the two chambers of Congress. I've managed to gather a group of progressives we can help get into Congress. I'll also be adding open seats in case there is interest in the progressive movement to get a candidate to run for that race. Let's support these other progressives for House &amp; Senate as well if you can:

If you're liberal you probably hate the enormous wealth inequality in this country, so what if there was a limit on how wealthy an individual could be, and if any income would exceed that number it would be taken and distributed to the poorest people in America?

"To everyone here who has Twitter, I got an idea &amp; I need a favor...","Hey Berners, I have this good idea on how we can further get the word out about the progressive candidates I've been posting as of late.

Every so often that I scour Twitter looking for new names to add to my list &amp; every now &amp; then, I would come across some users &amp; even the candidates themselves that made a list of some of the progressive challengers that I post on Reddit every month. It was mostly thanks to the members on Twitter that I was able to expand my list &amp; update it constantly. I'd bet the progressive challengers on my list would get even more exposure if their Twitter handles would be spread far &amp; wide across the social media platform.

Help getting through to my stepdad,"Hey there all,

I need your help getting through to my stepdad. We're both white, fyi.

I have been having some intense discussions with my parents recently and have hit a roadblock with my stepdad. My parents are both lifelong Democrats (my stepdad is a proud union member), which is obviously better than them being MAGA fans, but they are the old style of Democrat that didn't understand intersectionality, privelige, or structural racism. 

I have been trying to get him to understand that it is not just corporations and capitalism but white supremacy that creates structural inequality and violence in this country, but nothing really resonates with him. I have tried to show him good articles I have found online or books from my college library, but it just doesn't click and something he said recently really stuck with me because I hadn't ever really thought about it and I think it might be the key to getting him to wake up.

The thing that really hurt to hear him say when I was trying to talk with him about the 1619 project was that white people didn't enslave Africans because they were white, but that rich capitalists, who were white, did because they just had better technology than the Africans, and race wasn't the main factor.

I was trying to make him see how white culture is inherently oppressive and violent and he said ""well, why is it inherent? What makes it inherent?""

I asked him to explain and basically he says he doesn't buy into what I am telling him because it assumes that there is something different about white people from black or brown people, which he thinks is racist. Basically like is there something in white people's genes that make them racist and oppressive or did something in the past make white culture more violent and oppressive?

Basically I don't think I can convince him that white culture is more violent and hateful unless I can also tell him why it is more violent and hateful.",Liberal,AllyHendrix1995,0,1,2019-09-15,220,"Help getting through to my stepdad Hey there all,

Chinese national pleads guilty to running 'birth tourism' scheme that helped aliens give birth in US to secure birthright citizenship,"China is a pretty dangerous country. Thoughts?

SANTA ANA, Calif. – A Chinese national pleaded guilty today to federal criminal charges for running an Orange County-based “birth tourism” business that catered to wealthy pregnant clients and Chinese government officials, charging them tens of thousands of dollars to help them give birth in the United States so their children would get U.S. citizenship.

Dongyuan Li (李冬媛), 41, of Irvine, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit immigration fraud and one count of visa fraud. Li was one of 19 defendants named in a series of indictments unsealed earlier this year which resulted from an massive probe by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Los Angeles and IRS Criminal Investigation. Substantial assistance was provided by the Irvine Police Department and the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department.

Li is the first of the charged operators of birth tourism businesses to plead guilty. The remaining defendants either are pending trial or are fugitives.

Li admitted in her plea agreement that, from 2013 until March 2015, she operated a birth tourism company in Irvine and in China called You Win USA Vacation Services Corp. You Win would assist pregnant foreign nationals – typically from China – to travel to and remain in the United States to give birth so their children would receive birthright U.S. citizenship, according to the plea agreement.

According to a January 2019 federal grand jury indictment against Li, You Win advertised that it had served more than 500 Chinese birth tourism customers seeking U.S. birthright citizenship for their children. The indictment details that Li used 20 apartments in Irvine, charged each customer between $40,000 and $80,000, and she received $3 million in international wire transfers from China in two years.

Some You Win customers coached by the company made false statements on their visa applications and to U.S. immigration officials, Li’s plea agreement states. Li also admitted that the customers were advised on how to pass the U.S. Consulate interview in China, including by falsely stating that they were going to stay in the United States for only two weeks, when in reality, they planned to stay for up to three months to give birth.
“Homeland Security Investigations remains committed to working in collaboration with our law enforcement partners to identify and dismantle criminal schemes designed to exploit our nation’s legal immigration system,” said Joseph Macias, special agent in charge for HSI Los Angeles. “I commend the HSI and IRS investigators who aggressively pursued a tip that uncovered one of the largest birth tourism schemes to date to be federally prosecuted.”

Li further admitted that her customers bypassed U.S. immigration controls by booking two flights – the first from China to Hawaii and the second from Hawaii to Los Angeles International Airport – because they thought it would be easier to clear U.S. Customs through Hawaii. Li’s customers also were coached how to trick U.S. Customs at ports of entry by concealing their pregnancies, according to the plea agreement.

In October 2013, Li made a $30,965 rent payment for Irvine apartments used in her birth tourism operation, and in November 2013, she made a $30,321 rent payment for those apartments, the plea agreement states.

As part of her plea agreement, Li agreed to forfeit more than $850,000, a Murrieta residence worth more than $500,000, as well as several Mercedes-Benz vehicles.

U.S. District Judge James V. Selna scheduled a December 16 sentencing hearing, at which time Li will face a statutory maximum sentence of 15 years in federal prison.

This case is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California.

Even Adam Smith doesn't support trickle down economics.,"A quote from the last paragraph of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations:

""His employers constitute the third order, that of those who live by profit. It is the stock that is employed for the sake of profit, which puts into motion the greater part of the useful labour of every society. The plans and projects of the employers of stock regulate and direct all the most important operations of labour, and profit is the end proposed by all those plans and projects. But the rate of profit does not, like rent and wages, rise with the prosperity, and fall with the declension of the society. On the contrary, it is naturally low in rich, and high in poor countries, and it is always highest in the countries which are going fastest to ruin. The interest of this third order, therefore, has not the same connection with the general interest of the society as that of the other two.1° Merchants and master manufacturers are, in this order, the two classes of people who commonly employ the largest capitals, and who by their wealth draw to themselves the greatest share of the publick consideration. As during their whole lives they are engaged in plans and projects, they have frequently more acuteness ofunderstanding than the greaterpartof country gentlemen. As their thoughts, however, are commonly exercised rather about the interest of their own particular branch [397] of business, than about that of the society, their judgment, even when given with the greatest candour (which it has not been upon every occasion) is much more to be depended upon with regard to the former of those two objects, than with regard to the latter. Their superiority over the country gentleman is, not so much in their knowledge of the publick interest, as in their having a better knowledge of their own interest than he has of his. It is by this superior knowledge of their own interest that they have frequently imposed upon his generosity, and persuaded him to give up both his own interest and that of the publiek, from a very simple but honest conviction, that their interest, and not his, was the interest of the publick, al The interest of the dealers, however, in any particular branch of trade or manufactures, is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the publick. To widen the market and to narrow the competition, is always the interest of the dealers. To widen the market may frequently be agreeable enough to the interest of the publick; but to narrow the competition must always be against it, and can serve only to enable the dealers, by raising their profits above what they naturally would be, to levy, for their own benefit, an absurd tax upon the rest of their fellow-citizens. The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order, ought always to be listened to with great precaution, and ought never to be adopted [398] till after having been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but with the most suspicious attention. It comes from an order of men, whose interest is never exactly the same with that of the publick, who have generally an interest to deceive and even to oppress the publiek, and who accordingly have, upon many occasions, both deceived and oppressed it.""",Liberal,leftmit,1,1,2019-07-29,268,"Even Adam Smith doesn't support trickle down economics.

Is Universal Healthcare stealing from people?,"I got into a YouTube debate and there was a guy who said:


""It's amazing how liberals can't differentiate between voluntary giving and stealing. The point is we should all help one another out regardless of wealth, skin color, or gender because we want to, not because the government tells us to. And we should not be entitled and demand givings but rather humbly accept what others are willing to give. But when the government simply takes taxes and creates a permanent entitlement service, it eliminates that empathy and connection people have with each other when they voluntarily give and receive.

The Republican party believes in reducing taxes for all because people should be able to keep as much of their money as possible. In particular, businesses are given tax cuts because Republicans are practical. I understand that Democrats have their opinions that the rich SHOULD pay more taxes. That's a very ideological approach, but what good does that do in the real world? Raising taxes on businesses will just drive them out and push them to relocate in other nations. That's reality. Tax cuts for businesses work regardless if you think they're fair or not. GDP under Trump has gotten to over 3.0% because of these tax cuts. And Republicans believe welfare should be there as a safety net for those who actually need it, not an entitlement.

"I did the math with the mass shooting, guys","I know this is a super sensitive topic, but I didn't know where else to post this so here you go. I need to preface this with me telling you guys that I am in no way trying to take any attention away from victims, just to show that Trump supporters are using extremely flawed logic in an argument that should not need to be made and that I am not a math genius, but just trying to shed some light onto the situation.  
Recently, like I often do, I was looking through Trump's Instagram followers when I saw a guy comment that ""mass shootings happened under Obama too, idiots"", which made me think. What are the actual statistics of mass shootings under the Trump administration compared to Obama?  
This is counting both the injured and the death rates of victims of mass shootings under both the Trump and Obama administrations, using this ( [https://time.com/4965022/deadliest-mass-shooting-us-history/](https://time.com/4965022/deadliest-mass-shooting-us-history/) ) Times post about mass shootings. Let's start with Obama. Obama was in office for exactly eight years, which comes out to 2921 days. At that time, there were 38 mass shootings, which amounts to one every 78.86 days. In that time, 296 people lost their lives, while 295 people were injured, which amounts to one death from a mass shooting every 9.90 days and one victim injured every 9.86 days. This looks and is shocking. However, this is nothing compared to Trump's statistics.  
In his 927 days in office, there have been 28 mass shootings, which comes out to one mass shooting every 33.11 days. In that short time, 242 people lost their lives and 597 were injured in a mass shooting. Meaning that statistically, one person has been murdered in a mass shooting every 3.91 days, and one person has been injured every 1.55 days. This means that for every one and a half days Trump has been in office, a person has been left with possibly debilitating injuries, a mass shooting has occurred every month or so, and a person has died every four days from a preventable crime, because of his undying support for the NRA, which, by the way, spent 36.6 million dollars on his campaign according to [https://www.romper.com/p/how-much-did-the-nra-donate-to-trump-hes-been-loyal-to-the-organization-since-his-candidacy-2748576](https://www.romper.com/p/how-much-did-the-nra-donate-to-trump-hes-been-loyal-to-the-organization-since-his-candidacy-2748576) .",Liberal,megs_64,12,5,2019-08-05,261,"I did the math with the mass shooting, guys I know this is a super sensitive topic, but I didn't know where else to post this so here you go.

Recently, like I often do, I was looking through Trump's Instagram followers when I saw a guy comment that ""mass shootings happened under Obama too, idiots"", which made me think. What are the actual statistics of mass shootings under the Trump administration compared to Obama?  
This is counting both the injured and the death rates of victims of mass shootings under both the Trump and Obama administrations, using this ( [https://time.com/4965022/deadliest-mass-shooting-us-history/](https://time.com/4965022/deadliest-mass-shooting-us-history/) ) Times post about mass shootings. Let's start with Obama. Obama was in office for exactly eight years, which comes out to 2921 days. At that time, there were 38 mass shootings, which amounts to one every 78.86 days. In that time, 296 people lost their lives, while 295 people were injured, which amounts to one death from a mass shooting every 9.90 days and one victim injured every 9.86 days. This looks and is shocking. However, this is nothing compared to Trump's statistics.  
In his 927 days in office, there have been 28 mass shootings, which comes out to one mass shooting every 33.11 days. In that short time, 242 people lost their lives and 597 were injured in a mass shooting. Meaning that statistically, one person has been murdered in a mass shooting every 3.91 days, and one person has been injured every 1.55 days. This means that for every one and a half days Trump has been in office, a person has been left with possibly debilitating injuries, a mass shooting has occurred every month or so, and a person has died every four days from a preventable crime, because of his undying support for the NRA, which, by the way, spent 36.6 million dollars on his campaign according to [https://www.romper.com/p/how-much-did-the-nra-donate-to-trump-hes-been-loyal-to-the-organization-since-his-candidacy-2748576](https://www.romper.com/p/how-much-did-the-nra-donate-to-trump-hes-been-loyal-to-the-organization-since-his-candidacy-2748576) .",2459,43,2415,7.807510042216193,1

r/People_of_the_US: a new sub promoting healthy and constructive debates.,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I recently started a sub called r/People_of_the_US.

**What it is:** The goal is to have a place where everyone from the political spectrum can debate as equals. We promote healthy debate and putting aside differences. We believe we can do so in the name of patriotism because nothing screams patriotism more than coming together as one Nation. This is a place for political or cultural debates. (Notice that culture is pretty big a word, so there's a lot of freedom in this sub.

**Why is this important?:** In times like these it is important that the public remains critical towards its government, without falling in the trap of polarisation. The divide between Democrats and Republicans, or Left and Right, has been bigger the last years since it ever was (after the civil war).

**How do we do this?:** Our rules clearly state that bullying, hate-speech, being toxic and fake news are prohibited. People that cross this line can be warned, muted or even banned. We also promote a certain 'thic skin'. What some say in terms of politics and/or culture may seem hurtful or extreme others, but trough debate and decency we have not encountered any problems.

The sub is still relatively small but people are joining everyday. You as liberals (I too have a big liberal part in me) hopefully agree with me that only trough debates we can truly move forward in a peacefull way and that we should NOT repeat history it's faults.

Hopefuly we'll see you too on this sub!

(Please read the rules before interacting, there aren't many).

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you to r/Liberal for the platform, I've been a fan for quite some time now and will remain in the future! :)

Locus of Control and Politics,"I was reading about Locus of Control.  People generally fall into 2 categories, Internal or External.


A person's ""locus"" (plural ""loci"", Latin for ""place"" or ""location"") is conceptualized as internal (a belief that one can control one's own life) or external (a belief that life is controlled by outside factors which the person cannot influence, or that chance or fate controls their lives).

Individuals with a strong internal locus of control believe events in their life derive primarily from their own actions: for example, when receiving exam results, people with an internal locus of control tend to praise or blame themselves and their abilities. 

People with a strong external locus of control tend to praise or blame external factors such as the teacher or the exam.

College Debt Can Kiss My Ass,"Today, August 10, 2019, 3,707 days since I graduated from college, I am finally done paying college loans.  That's over 10 years of monthly payments.  Yes, I've been working at a well paying and steady job since graduation, and yes I am lucky to have been in a position where my family could afford to help pay the lion's share of college costs in the first place.  Also, yes, I knew there would be some debt associated with picking an out-of-state university.  But as an 18-year old you don't quite grasp what having debt for 10 years is going to be like.  Now, as a 32 year old man who is married with a mortgage, I do understand the totality of how debt can affect people's lives.  I feel very lucky, and I am very appreciative of the things I mentioned above that have lessened the impacts of this college debt on mine and my wife's lives.  Now, we are both college debt free.

I think about kids going into college now, and how colleges and universities across the country are charging more for tuition than ever before.  Luckily I think college aged students are more aware of the overall circumstances of paying for college now.  College debt is a top-of-the-list topic for public office candidates, most notably as an issue discussed at length during the recent Democratic debates.  Good.  It should be.  The public debate around Millenials vs Baby-boomers is rooted in the fact that younger generations are on a 10 year delay starting their ""adult lives"".  People are getting married, buying houses, and having kids later in life because they have this anchor around their leg that they can't shed with jobs that are available.  Going to college is supposed to position graduates for well paying jobs that can help pay college debt back rather expeditiously.  For me it took 10 years.  For students now it's going to take twice that.

This isn't even taking into account people who can't afford college at all and decide not to go.  I've seen figures stating that going to and graduating from college will result in a life-time earnings difference of $900k or more vs only graduating high-school.  Thus, as a country, we have to take this issue seriously and make it easier for people to get higher education.  A lot of the democratic candidates are talking about free college (Bernie, Warren, Harris, Biden), some are challenging that idea in that it isn't fair for all Americans to help subsidize only those who want to go to college (Buttigieg, Klobuchar), and other ideas are out there like free community college and trade schools, or one of my favorites, loan forgiveness for 2-years of federal service work.

Whatever your thoughts about how to solve the issue are, I just ask that you realize paying for college IS an issue facing our country.  Pay attention to what candidates are saying and make sure it stays part of the national political conversation.

Full Transcript of Beto O'Rourke's August 15 Speech on White Nationalist Terrorism,"Transcript by /u/Privacy__Account

Good morning! Buenos días! Isn't it beautiful to hear the El Paso High band practicing behind us? We may hear the strains of the next song coming through over the course of this conversation but I was just thinking about the fact that Charlotte and I—raised by Melissa and Pat, along with our sister Erin—grew up about four blocks from here. And, when I would walked to El Paso High, I would walk through this park, climb over this wall, and make my way to the side of this mountain and see Chris and Jim and Robert and our friends at El Paso High. And, it’s definitely a part of who I am, helped to form me and shape me, and makes me so proud of this community, who we are, just looking out at everyone who has taken the time to be here this morning.

I just want to begin with my gratitude and my thanks, and an expression of my overwhelming pride in this community at this moment. After this horrific tragedy on August 3rd, where 22 lives were taken from us, dozens more injured and still grieving, many still at Del Sol and University Medical Center not yet through the woods but being pulled through by their families and their friends and this community. The way that we have met this tragedy, though we were targeted because we are a community of immigrants, because we are a community that is 85% Mexican American, though they tried to define us by our differences, and we showed just how strong we are, and I hope gave an example to the rest of the country about who we can become as America.

 

Last week we went over to the memorial that’s just outside of the Walmart, and we were paying our respects along with hundreds of El Pasoans. There was a band playing; there were matachines dancing; there were preachers praying; there were families who just in silence, and through tears, were trying to take in what had just happened to this community, and to this country, and to all of us.

And I remember that a chaplain found me and brought me over. He said, there is somebody that I would like you to meet. And he introduced me to a gentleman named Antonio, who was kneeling in front of a cross, and on that white cross in black paint it said “Margie.”

And the chaplain told me, “He’s been here every single since that terrorist act. In front of the cross that represents his wife, that woman he loved, that woman with whom he built a life, that woman who means everything to him. He doesn't have other family in this community, doesn't have a lot of friends right now to grieve with, but I want you to go meet him and I want you to ask him about his story.”

And I did, and I went up to Antonio and he told me about Margie, and the most beautiful smile broke through on his face, and I thought of the grace he was showing to me and others who were there to mourn with him. You could forgive him if he was consumed by his grief and didn't want to talk to, or listen to, or be with, any of us… but that wasn't the way that he responded.

And then the chaplain—and I didn't know how this would work out—he said, “Antonio, stand up, tell the hundreds of people here about your wife Margie.” And shyly, in a voice you could almost not hear at first, he did that. He began to tell his wife’s story.

And then the chaplain said, “Everybody come around, this guy needs a hug right now.” And then one after another, tens then dozens, hundreds of El Pasoans surrounded him, and hugged him, and put their hands on him, and he was crying and it was so powerful and cathartic for him, for us, for this community, and anyone in this nation who was taking the time to watch what was happening. And that’s just one of many stories we that we’ve learned, and that we’ve witnessed over the last two weeks.

 

Flying home from Las Vegas, Nevada, when I got the news, a young gentleman named Chris walks up to me, “I’m flying back to El Paso as well, because I just learned that my mother, Rosemary, has been shot at that Walmart. I have no idea how she’s doing, what her condition is, nothing! No news.”

And I said, “If it is any help, I, and my wife Amy, would love to join you.”

And he said, “That would be great. I could use the help right now.”

And, we went over to UMC. When you walked into that room, Chris, and your mother Rosemary—who had been shot in the chest, both of her lungs perforated, tubes coming out of her chest snaking through the hospital sheet, coming down onto the floor, a mask over her face—and the biggest smile I have ever seen produced by another human being, to see you in that room. And for your sisters to be there as well, and the strength and grace to greet me, a complete stranger in her life, and to make sure that I felt welcomed in her intensive care unit hospital room. To meet the nurses and the doctors and the frontline staff that were going to make sure that she was going to make it. And, I wonder to myself, where in the world does she get that strength and that courage? Well, the next day at Del Sol hospital I found the answer.

It was her mother, who was in her early 80s, who was shot in the stomach. And though she was shot, in the aftermath of that shooting she tended tended to other victims in the parking lot and inside of the store before she ever thought about the wounds she that was walking with… that ultimately forced her to have to sit down, and then lay down, and to be taken into a hospital where again her life was saved, by extraordinary El Pasoans from this this community.

One of whom, when she was on her way into her shift, the doctor stopped me and she said, “Hey, Beto, I love the way this community is coming together right now, and I just want you to know that I’m going into my shift right now. I’m a doctor, I’m going to keep saving these lives, but I also want you to know that I’m an immigrant. I’m not unlike so many people in this community, so many millions in America who by their very presence and their sacrifice and their service make this country great.”

 

This is a beautiful community, one of if not the safest cities in the United States of America. Safe not despite the fact that we are a city of immigrants. More than a quarter who live here came here, chose us, left to their hometown, their family, their culture, their language far too often, to start anew here as strangers in a strange land, to do better for themselves and for their kids, but also to do better for us. And they have. And this connection that we have with Ciudad Juarez is one of the most beautiful that you will find between two cities from two countries anywhere in the world. Three million, with two histories, two nationalities joined—not separated—by the Rio Grande river, forming something far greater, and more powerful, than the sum of their parts or the number of people involved.

We went to one of the funerals in Ciudad Juarez. Eight Mexican nationals killed on that date here in our community. And again, the grace that those survivors and families showed in the face of such adversity and pain and suffering, that I can only imagine—it made us sad as well but it also inspired us, with the strength and the courage that they showed.

 

We owe this community time to heal. We owe one another our very best. As those families may get through the toughest days they have ever known, the toughest days we have ever known. But from what I have seen since August 3rd, this community, El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, is more than up to the task. There is an embarrassment of riches of kindness, and compassion, and help, and service, in El Paso right now. You know that because you are part of that. But I think we also owe ourselves, this community, the families that have been affected, answers about why this happened here in El Paso. Answers about what it is going to take to ensure this does not continue to happen in El Paso, or in communities like ours or anywhere across the United States.

I begin with the gun that was used in that act of terror and the number of guns we have in this country right now. You may have read the news that the killer's mother, when she learned he had ordered an AK-47 and had received it, called the police in Allen, Texas.

“What does my son, who is not enlisted in the military, who has no need for a weapon of war, no training in it, what does he need with this gun?”

Though she may not have known how to articulate the question, she was asking for help for herself, for her son, and really by extension for this country. I know from listening to the surgeons and the doctors who have treated these gunshot victims at Del Sol and UMC—some of whom also served at William Beaumont Army Medical Center, have been trained in combat trauma care—the wounds they are seeing are like the wounds that they saw in Afghanistan and Iraq. These weapons, like the AK-47, were designed to kill people as effectively, as efficiently, and as great a number as possible, and that is exactly what they are doing. When you listen to the doctors describe the internal injuries of these survivors, it is absolutely horrifying.

But to this point, we have a Congress too craven to act; a democracy not up to the task, that favors those who can pay for access and influence and outcomes; the complicity and the silence of those who are in positions of public trust; and that is exactly what has happened here in this country. We have a racism in America that is as old as America itself; an intolerance towards those who do not look like, or pray like, or love like, or speak like, the majority in this country. That’s part of our story. We absolutely need to tell it, to face it, to acknowledge it, if we are ever going to change it. But we have always tried, until now, to change that.

 

Until this President, who so openly speaks in racist terms, so openly favors one race, one religion, one kind of people in this country over every other kind of people in this country. Proposing to ban all Muslims, all people of one religion, one faith, from the shores of a country that is comprised of people from the world over, from every walk of life, from every tradition of faith.

It is hard to imagine this is happening in America, but it is happening in America. To tell people of color, born in this country, to go back to where they came from. To describe Klansmen, and Neo-Nazis, and white supremacists, and white nationalist terrorists, as “very fine people” after they have marched and chanted, “Jews, you will not replace us.”

Someone in his maiden speech for the highest office in the land—the greatest position of power and public trust—who described Mexican immigrants—though they commit crimes at a lower rate than those born in this country—as “rapists” and “criminals.” Constantly warns through incessant repetition of “invasions” and “infestations” and calls people—human beings, let's be clear, the most desperate and vulnerable human beings fleeing the deadliest countries on the face of the planet, showing up here without a dime to their name, without any prospect of hope or advancement except that they came here to this country of asylum-seekers and refugees and immigrants, this country known by the Statue of Liberty—he calls them “animals,” and “predators,” and “killers.”

And this May, of this year, in Florida, as he warns about this “invasion” and he asks the question to the assembled masses, “What are we going to do to stop these people?”

And someone yells out, “Shoot them!”

And the crowd roars their approval. In the face of that, the President signals his consent: he smiles, he laughs, he encourages more of it.

 

Every single year for the last three, hate crimes have been on the rise in this country. Those counties that hosted a Donald Trump rally saw hate crimes increase by more than 200%. I want to make clear to you, to us, to the country, that what he says and what he does, does not just offends our sensibilities, or our understanding of the traditions of this great country, it changes who we are as a country.

You do not get kids in cages until you have given people permission to put them in cages, by calling them animals, and seeking to dehumanize them. You don't lose the lives of seven children in the custody and care of the wealthiest, the most powerful country on the face of the planet, unless you have made it possible. And you do not get somebody driving 600 miles to come to this community—in his manifesto repeating the very words used by the President of the United States to justify this act of terror, and hatred, and violence, and death.

And yet in the face of this, our institutions have failed us.

And in this democracy, none of us can take any comfort or feel in any way superior, because all of us are part of the institutions; whether it is our Legislature, our Congress, the press, social media, they are all comprised of all of us. But they have been impotent in the face of the gravest threat that we have ever known, one that we experienced firsthand here in El Paso a week ago Saturday. It’s almost as if the bigger the lie, the more obvious the injustice, the more furious the pace of this bizarre behavior, the more incapable we are of seeing it and clearly naming it and acting against it.

 

This attack on El Paso is an attack on America. It is an attack on our ideal of what America can be, an America that has not been for so many in this country, based on their race, their ethnicity, their country of national origin, their gender, their sexual orientation. As Langston Hughes said in his poem about an America that was not an America for everyone, it is the land that has never been yet, and yet must be.

It is in this land, in this very community, after the election of this President, at LBJ Elementary, that a third-grade student approached us and asked, “Why does the president not like me?”

It’s in this country, in Houston, Texas, when I retold the story that a family came to me and they said, “It resonates with us because we have a third-grader in our home. She's not Mexican-American, she's Muslim, and she wonders if there is some other country we are supposed to go back to. Though she was born here, though she’s a US citizen here, though she's just as American as anyone else.”

When we allow this country to be defined along lines of race, and ethnicity, and religion; when we allow a commander-in-chief to not only welcome that but the violence that follows, to defy our laws, our institutions, and any ethical or moral boundaries; the end of that road is the end of this idea of America. The end of an America where every single one of us could belong and have a future.

I'm confident that if, at this moment, we do not wake up to this threat, then we, as a country, will die in our sleep.

 

The response to this has to be that each of us make a commitment to see clearly, to speak honestly, and to act decisively in this moment of truth. I, for one, see more clearly than ever that in a country that has 320 million people, but 390 million firearms, that we have too many guns—too many people who own them, and use them, and threaten us with them right now—for the good of this country, for the good of the 40,000 of our fellow Americans, our fellow human beings, who will lose their lives to gun violence this year and every year going forward until we change course.

And I see more clearly than I ever have, that not only do we need universal background checks, not only do we need red flag laws that would stop somebody when they pose a danger to themselves or someone else, not only do we need to end the sale of assault weapons and weapons of war that were designed for the battlefield and have no place in our communities, but we must as a country buy those weapons, take them off the streets altogether. There are millions of them today. And their ability to inspire terror, to make our kids and your kids afraid to walk into that classroom at Mesita [elementary school] or El Paso High because we know as a country, we’ve accepted the murder of 6- and 7-year-old children where they sat at school, we’ve accepted high school students being hunted down in the halls of these institutions like El Paso High right behind me.

It is time for us to be bold, to stand together, to stand up against those interests who would prevent us from saving the lives of our fellow Americans.

 

It is more clear to me now than it has ever been before, that when we do not make progress on the human dignity of our fellow Americans, the ability to work a job—and just one job, not two or three because you’re paid a living wage—to be able to depend on healthcare as something that’s a right that you don’t have to worry about, so that you’re well enough to live to your full potential; to know that your community, that you, and your family count; not only is it the right thing to do, to make sure that this country is realizing its full potential and promise for every single one of us, when we fail to do that, you provide fertile ground for the kind of demagogues we have an office right now, who will use your fear and your frustration against you, against us, against one another. Demonize immigrants and minorities, blame them for the problems that you have.

I see more clearly now than I ever have before, that immigrants in this community, in this state, in this country, will continue to be attacked—not just killed as they were at the Walmart but terrorized as we just saw last week in Mississippi. Six hundred people who came to this country for the privilege of working the toughest, shittiest jobs that no one else here would allow their children to work, in chicken processing plants, in picking cotton, in working in the gin, working two or three shifts, maybe making minimum wage if they are lucky. Far too often, their immigration status used as leverage against them to pay them something far less or nothing at all. [Microphone stops working for one sentence.]

This has, in part, caused this kind of treatment of the people who make America great, who are part of who we are, the very fabric of our lives, and the response to that is no more being defensive, or being on the back foot, or apologizing for who we are and who we want to be. It is using the example of El Paso, Texas, and showing that when we legalize those who are in this country; when we free DREAMers from any fear of deportation by making them US citizens; when we elevate the asylum-seekers, the refugee, that person who has no other hope or choice but to come here; not only is it good for them, it is great for the United States of America, and fundamental to any success, or strength, or safety, or security we could hope to have. And I see more clearly than I ever have before that if we do not tell our story, others will tell it for us. This proud community has to tell the world just who we are, and what made us so special; and to remind ourselves that though we have something absolutely extraordinary here in El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, though we are separated by hundreds of miles from the other centers of power and population, as Martin Luther King reminded us, we were all caught in this inextricable, inescapable network of mutuality, we are tied in a single garment of destiny. Sooner or later the challenges, the problems of this country will come find you, as they came and found us on August 3rd.

So telling the full, and real, and true story of this country—just who made us great in the first place, on whose backs America was built, and whose descendants could profit from it and whose descendants were virtually locked out from it—and knowing that and confronting it directly, clear eyed, gives us the best chance of writing the next chapter of that story, whose ideal and goal and vision must be true and real equality and equity for every single one of us. Every single American treated with the dignity and respect that they are owed as Americans, as human beings, just the way that we do it here in El Paso, Texas.

 

Monday, Amy and I took Ulysses and Molly and Henry to school. This morning, we rushed them out the door, Janine gave them a ride to Mesita [elementary school] and to Wiggs [middle school], and I've got to tell you, there's some part of me—it's a big part of me—that wants to stay here, and be with my family, and be with my community. I love El Paso. There have even been some who suggested that I stay in Texas and run for Senate. But that would not be good enough for this community. That would not be good enough for El Paso. That would not be good enough for this country. We must take the fight directly to the source of this problem. That person who has caused this pain and placed this country in this moment of peril, and that is Donald Trump. [applause] I want to be the leader for this country that we need right now and that we do not have. Someone who will not only not tear us apart but do everything within their power to bring us together; someone who doesn't inflame but instead heals; somebody doesn't work with fear but instead, hope. In other words, I want to be the kind of leader for this country that El Paso has raised me and taught me to be.

 

But as we head back on the campaign trail today, I know there is a way [applause] I know there is a way to do this better, and that came to me last week. Someone asked if I going to be heading back to Iowa to go to the Iowa state fair: corndogs and Ferris wheels.

And I said, “No, I can't go back for that. But I also cannot go back to that.”

The kind of challenges that we face in this country at this moment of crisis require an urgency, unless we want to reap the consequences of failing to meet them, consequences that we lived and I hope learned from in El Paso on August 3rd. And so to those places where Donald Trump has been terrorizing, and terrifying, and demeaning our fellow Americans, that's where you'll find me in this campaign. [applause] From El Paso we are heading to Mississippi to be with those families who have lost a loved one—temporarily, maybe for the indefinite future—because of hostility of this administration towards immigrants. And I want to be there to help lift them up, to tell their story, to remind this country just who we are at our best. Anyone that this president puts down, we're going to do our best to lift up. [applause] In those communities, so long forgotten, counted out, not counted in to begin with, we're going to go there as well, not only to learn about their challenges and their problems, but as is so often the case, to learn from them about the solutions to their challenges and the problems; their solutions to our challenges and problems as a country; places all over the country, places like El Paso.

Though we bore the brunt of this attack, of this hatred, of this violence, of this country’s inaction in the face of these threats, I also know that this community holds the answers not just for our future here in El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, but the future of this country. We see our differences not as dangerous or disqualifying, not just to be tolerated or respected, but to be embraced as fundamental to any hope we have of making it as a community, of making it as a country. I'm so fortunate to have been raised in this community, with Amy to be raising our children in this community, to be here right now in this community. I just want to promise you that every single day of this campaign, I will take the courage and the kindness, the warmth, the strength, the resolve of this community with me, and I will share it with the rest of the country. Because we and El Paso, and I hope that we as Americans, still believe that though we have not realized the idea of America for everyone, it is still within our grasp, and we the people of the border can lead the way.

And, when I would walked to El Paso High, I would walk through this park, climb over this wall, and make my way to the side of this mountain and see Chris and Jim and Robert and our friends at El Paso High. And, it’s definitely a part of who I am, helped to form me and shape me, and makes me so proud of this community, who we are, just looking out at everyone who has taken the time to be here this morning.

I just want to begin with my gratitude and my thanks, and an expression of my overwhelming pride in this community at this moment. After this horrific tragedy on August 3rd, where 22 lives were taken from us, dozens more injured and still grieving, many still at Del Sol and University Medical Center not yet through the woods but being pulled through by their families and their friends and this community. The way that we have met this tragedy, though we were targeted because we are a community of immigrants, because we are a community that is 85% Mexican American, though they tried to define us by our differences, and we showed just how strong we are, and I hope gave an example to the rest of the country about who we can become as America.

 

Last week we went over to the memorial that’s just outside of the Walmart, and we were paying our respects along with hundreds of El Pasoans. There was a band playing; there were matachines dancing; there were preachers praying; there were families who just in silence, and through tears, were trying to take in what had just happened to this community, and to this country, and to all of us.

And I remember that a chaplain found me and brought me over. He said, there is somebody that I would like you to meet. And he introduced me to a gentleman named Antonio, who was kneeling in front of a cross, and on that white cross in black paint it said “Margie.”

And the chaplain told me, “He’s been here every single since that terrorist act. In front of the cross that represents his wife, that woman he loved, that woman with whom he built a life, that woman who means everything to him. He doesn't have other family in this community, doesn't have a lot of friends right now to grieve with, but I want you to go meet him and I want you to ask him about his story.”

And I did, and I went up to Antonio and he told me about Margie, and the most beautiful smile broke through on his face, and I thought of the grace he was showing to me and others who were there to mourn with him. You could forgive him if he was consumed by his grief and didn't want to talk to, or listen to, or be with, any of us… but that wasn't the way that he responded.

And then the chaplain—and I didn't know how this would work out—he said, “Antonio, stand up, tell the hundreds of people here about your wife Margie.” And shyly, in a voice you could almost not hear at first, he did that. He began to tell his wife’s story.

And then the chaplain said, “Everybody come around, this guy needs a hug right now.” And then one after another, tens then dozens, hundreds of El Pasoans surrounded him, and hugged him, and put their hands on him, and he was crying and it was so powerful and cathartic for him, for us, for this community, and anyone in this nation who was taking the time to watch what was happening. And that’s just one of many stories we that we’ve learned, and that we’ve witnessed over the last two weeks.

 

Flying home from Las Vegas, Nevada, when I got the news, a young gentleman named Chris walks up to me, “I’m flying back to El Paso as well, because I just learned that my mother, Rosemary, has been shot at that Walmart. I have no idea how she’s doing, what her condition is, nothing! No news.”

And I said, “If it is any help, I, and my wife Amy, would love to join you.”

And he said, “That would be great. I could use the help right now.”

And, we went over to UMC. When you walked into that room, Chris, and your mother Rosemary—who had been shot in the chest, both of her lungs perforated, tubes coming out of her chest snaking through the hospital sheet, coming down onto the floor, a mask over her face—and the biggest smile I have ever seen produced by another human being, to see you in that room. And for your sisters to be there as well, and the strength and grace to greet me, a complete stranger in her life, and to make sure that I felt welcomed in her intensive care unit hospital room. To meet the nurses and the doctors and the frontline staff that were going to make sure that she was going to make it. And, I wonder to myself, where in the world does she get that strength and that courage? Well, the next day at Del Sol hospital I found the answer.

It was her mother, who was in her early 80s, who was shot in the stomach. And though she was shot, in the aftermath of that shooting she tended tended to other victims in the parking lot and inside of the store before she ever thought about the wounds she that was walking with… that ultimately forced her to have to sit down, and then lay down, and to be taken into a hospital where again her life was saved, by extraordinary El Pasoans from this this community.

One of whom, when she was on her way into her shift, the doctor stopped me and she said, “Hey, Beto, I love the way this community is coming together right now, and I just want you to know that I’m going into my shift right now. I’m a doctor, I’m going to keep saving these lives, but I also want you to know that I’m an immigrant. I’m not unlike so many people in this community, so many millions in America who by their very presence and their sacrifice and their service make this country great.”

 

This is a beautiful community, one of if not the safest cities in the United States of America. Safe not despite the fact that we are a city of immigrants. More than a quarter who live here came here, chose us, left to their hometown, their family, their culture, their language far too often, to start anew here as strangers in a strange land, to do better for themselves and for their kids, but also to do better for us. And they have. And this connection that we have with Ciudad Juarez is one of the most beautiful that you will find between two cities from two countries anywhere in the world. Three million, with two histories, two nationalities joined—not separated—by the Rio Grande river, forming something far greater, and more powerful, than the sum of their parts or the number of people involved.

We went to one of the funerals in Ciudad Juarez. Eight Mexican nationals killed on that date here in our community. And again, the grace that those survivors and families showed in the face of such adversity and pain and suffering, that I can only imagine—it made us sad as well but it also inspired us, with the strength and the courage that they showed.

 

We owe this community time to heal. We owe one another our very best. As those families may get through the toughest days they have ever known, the toughest days we have ever known. But from what I have seen since August 3rd, this community, El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, is more than up to the task. There is an embarrassment of riches of kindness, and compassion, and help, and service, in El Paso right now. You know that because you are part of that. But I think we also owe ourselves, this community, the families that have been affected, answers about why this happened here in El Paso. Answers about what it is going to take to ensure this does not continue to happen in El Paso, or in communities like ours or anywhere across the United States.

I begin with the gun that was used in that act of terror and the number of guns we have in this country right now. You may have read the news that the killer's mother, when she learned he had ordered an AK-47 and had received it, called the police in Allen, Texas.

“What does my son, who is not enlisted in the military, who has no need for a weapon of war, no training in it, what does he need with this gun?”

Though she may not have known how to articulate the question, she was asking for help for herself, for her son, and really by extension for this country. I know from listening to the surgeons and the doctors who have treated these gunshot victims at Del Sol and UMC—some of whom also served at William Beaumont Army Medical Center, have been trained in combat trauma care—the wounds they are seeing are like the wounds that they saw in Afghanistan and Iraq. These weapons, like the AK-47, were designed to kill people as effectively, as efficiently, and as great a number as possible, and that is exactly what they are doing. When you listen to the doctors describe the internal injuries of these survivors, it is absolutely horrifying.

But to this point, we have a Congress too craven to act; a democracy not up to the task, that favors those who can pay for access and influence and outcomes; the complicity and the silence of those who are in positions of public trust; and that is exactly what has happened here in this country. We have a racism in America that is as old as America itself; an intolerance towards those who do not look like, or pray like, or love like, or speak like, the majority in this country. That’s part of our story. We absolutely need to tell it, to face it, to acknowledge it, if we are ever going to change it. But we have always tried, until now, to change that.

 

Until this President, who so openly speaks in racist terms, so openly favors one race, one religion, one kind of people in this country over every other kind of people in this country. Proposing to ban all Muslims, all people of one religion, one faith, from the shores of a country that is comprised of people from the world over, from every walk of life, from every tradition of faith.

It is hard to imagine this is happening in America, but it is happening in America. To tell people of color, born in this country, to go back to where they came from. To describe Klansmen, and Neo-Nazis, and white supremacists, and white nationalist terrorists, as “very fine people” after they have marched and chanted, “Jews, you will not replace us.”

Someone in his maiden speech for the highest office in the land—the greatest position of power and public trust—who described Mexican immigrants—though they commit crimes at a lower rate than those born in this country—as “rapists” and “criminals.” Constantly warns through incessant repetition of “invasions” and “infestations” and calls people—human beings, let's be clear, the most desperate and vulnerable human beings fleeing the deadliest countries on the face of the planet, showing up here without a dime to their name, without any prospect of hope or advancement except that they came here to this country of asylum-seekers and refugees and immigrants, this country known by the Statue of Liberty—he calls them “animals,” and “predators,” and “killers.”

And this May, of this year, in Florida, as he warns about this “invasion” and he asks the question to the assembled masses, “What are we going to do to stop these people?”

And someone yells out, “Shoot them!”

And the crowd roars their approval. In the face of that, the President signals his consent: he smiles, he laughs, he encourages more of it.

 

Every single year for the last three, hate crimes have been on the rise in this country. Those counties that hosted a Donald Trump rally saw hate crimes increase by more than 200%. I want to make clear to you, to us, to the country, that what he says and what he does, does not just offends our sensibilities, or our understanding of the traditions of this great country, it changes who we are as a country.

You do not get kids in cages until you have given people permission to put them in cages, by calling them animals, and seeking to dehumanize them. You don't lose the lives of seven children in the custody and care of the wealthiest, the most powerful country on the face of the planet, unless you have made it possible. And you do not get somebody driving 600 miles to come to this community—in his manifesto repeating the very words used by the President of the United States to justify this act of terror, and hatred, and violence, and death.

And yet in the face of this, our institutions have failed us.

And in this democracy, none of us can take any comfort or feel in any way superior, because all of us are part of the institutions; whether it is our Legislature, our Congress, the press, social media, they are all comprised of all of us. But they have been impotent in the face of the gravest threat that we have ever known, one that we experienced firsthand here in El Paso a week ago Saturday. It’s almost as if the bigger the lie, the more obvious the injustice, the more furious the pace of this bizarre behavior, the more incapable we are of seeing it and clearly naming it and acting against it.

 

This attack on El Paso is an attack on America. It is an attack on our ideal of what America can be, an America that has not been for so many in this country, based on their race, their ethnicity, their country of national origin, their gender, their sexual orientation. As Langston Hughes said in his poem about an America that was not an America for everyone, it is the land that has never been yet, and yet must be.

It is in this land, in this very community, after the election of this President, at LBJ Elementary, that a third-grade student approached us and asked, “Why does the president not like me?”

It’s in this country, in Houston, Texas, when I retold the story that a family came to me and they said, “It resonates with us because we have a third-grader in our home. She's not Mexican-American, she's Muslim, and she wonders if there is some other country we are supposed to go back to. Though she was born here, though she’s a US citizen here, though she's just as American as anyone else.”

When we allow this country to be defined along lines of race, and ethnicity, and religion; when we allow a commander-in-chief to not only welcome that but the violence that follows, to defy our laws, our institutions, and any ethical or moral boundaries; the end of that road is the end of this idea of America. The end of an America where every single one of us could belong and have a future.

I'm confident that if, at this moment, we do not wake up to this threat, then we, as a country, will die in our sleep.

 

The response to this has to be that each of us make a commitment to see clearly, to speak honestly, and to act decisively in this moment of truth. I, for one, see more clearly than ever that in a country that has 320 million people, but 390 million firearms, that we have too many guns—too many people who own them, and use them, and threaten us with them right now—for the good of this country, for the good of the 40,000 of our fellow Americans, our fellow human beings, who will lose their lives to gun violence this year and every year going forward until we change course.

And I see more clearly than I ever have, that not only do we need universal background checks, not only do we need red flag laws that would stop somebody when they pose a danger to themselves or someone else, not only do we need to end the sale of assault weapons and weapons of war that were designed for the battlefield and have no place in our communities, but we must as a country buy those weapons, take them off the streets altogether. There are millions of them today. And their ability to inspire terror, to make our kids and your kids afraid to walk into that classroom at Mesita [elementary school] or El Paso High because we know as a country, we’ve accepted the murder of 6- and 7-year-old children where they sat at school, we’ve accepted high school students being hunted down in the halls of these institutions like El Paso High right behind me.

It is time for us to be bold, to stand together, to stand up against those interests who would prevent us from saving the lives of our fellow Americans.

 

It is more clear to me now than it has ever been before, that when we do not make progress on the human dignity of our fellow Americans, the ability to work a job—and just one job, not two or three because you’re paid a living wage—to be able to depend on healthcare as something that’s a right that you don’t have to worry about, so that you’re well enough to live to your full potential; to know that your community, that you, and your family count; not only is it the right thing to do, to make sure that this country is realizing its full potential and promise for every single one of us, when we fail to do that, you provide fertile ground for the kind of demagogues we have an office right now, who will use your fear and your frustration against you, against us, against one another. Demonize immigrants and minorities, blame them for the problems that you have.

I see more clearly now than I ever have before, that immigrants in this community, in this state, in this country, will continue to be attacked—not just killed as they were at the Walmart but terrorized as we just saw last week in Mississippi. Six hundred people who came to this country for the privilege of working the toughest, shittiest jobs that no one else here would allow their children to work, in chicken processing plants, in picking cotton, in working in the gin, working two or three shifts, maybe making minimum wage if they are lucky. Far too often, their immigration status used as leverage against them to pay them something far less or nothing at all. [Microphone stops working for one sentence.]

This has, in part, caused this kind of treatment of the people who make America great, who are part of who we are, the very fabric of our lives, and the response to that is no more being defensive, or being on the back foot, or apologizing for who we are and who we want to be. It is using the example of El Paso, Texas, and showing that when we legalize those who are in this country; when we free DREAMers from any fear of deportation by making them US citizens; when we elevate the asylum-seekers, the refugee, that person who has no other hope or choice but to come here; not only is it good for them, it is great for the United States of America, and fundamental to any success, or strength, or safety, or security we could hope to have. And I see more clearly than I ever have before that if we do not tell our story, others will tell it for us. This proud community has to tell the world just who we are, and what made us so special; and to remind ourselves that though we have something absolutely extraordinary here in El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, though we are separated by hundreds of miles from the other centers of power and population, as Martin Luther King reminded us, we were all caught in this inextricable, inescapable network of mutuality, we are tied in a single garment of destiny. Sooner or later the challenges, the problems of this country will come find you, as they came and found us on August 3rd.

So telling the full, and real, and true story of this country—just who made us great in the first place, on whose backs America was built, and whose descendants could profit from it and whose descendants were virtually locked out from it—and knowing that and confronting it directly, clear eyed, gives us the best chance of writing the next chapter of that story, whose ideal and goal and vision must be true and real equality and equity for every single one of us. Every single American treated with the dignity and respect that they are owed as Americans, as human beings, just the way that we do it here in El Paso, Texas.

 

Monday, Amy and I took Ulysses and Molly and Henry to school. This morning, we rushed them out the door, Janine gave them a ride to Mesita [elementary school] and to Wiggs [middle school], and I've got to tell you, there's some part of me—it's a big part of me—that wants to stay here, and be with my family, and be with my community. I love El Paso. There have even been some who suggested that I stay in Texas and run for Senate. But that would not be good enough for this community. That would not be good enough for El Paso. That would not be good enough for this country. We must take the fight directly to the source of this problem. That person who has caused this pain and placed this country in this moment of peril, and that is Donald Trump. [applause] I want to be the leader for this country that we need right now and that we do not have. Someone who will not only not tear us apart but do everything within their power to bring us together; someone who doesn't inflame but instead heals; somebody doesn't work with fear but instead, hope. In other words, I want to be the kind of leader for this country that El Paso has raised me and taught me to be.

 

But as we head back on the campaign trail today, I know there is a way [applause] I know there is a way to do this better, and that came to me last week. Someone asked if I going to be heading back to Iowa to go to the Iowa state fair: corndogs and Ferris wheels.

And I said, “No, I can't go back for that. But I also cannot go back to that.”

The kind of challenges that we face in this country at this moment of crisis require an urgency, unless we want to reap the consequences of failing to meet them, consequences that we lived and I hope learned from in El Paso on August 3rd. And so to those places where Donald Trump has been terrorizing, and terrifying, and demeaning our fellow Americans, that's where you'll find me in this campaign. [applause] From El Paso we are heading to Mississippi to be with those families who have lost a loved one—temporarily, maybe for the indefinite future—because of hostility of this administration towards immigrants. And I want to be there to help lift them up, to tell their story, to remind this country just who we are at our best. Anyone that this president puts down, we're going to do our best to lift up. [applause] In those communities, so long forgotten, counted out, not counted in to begin with, we're going to go there as well, not only to learn about their challenges and their problems, but as is so often the case, to learn from them about the solutions to their challenges and the problems; their solutions to our challenges and problems as a country; places all over the country, places like El Paso.

Though we bore the brunt of this attack, of this hatred, of this violence, of this country’s inaction in the face of these threats, I also know that this community holds the answers not just for our future here in El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, but the future of this country. We see our differences not as dangerous or disqualifying, not just to be tolerated or respected, but to be embraced as fundamental to any hope we have of making it as a community, of making it as a country. I'm so fortunate to have been raised in this community, with Amy to be raising our children in this community, to be here right now in this community. I just want to promise you that every single day of this campaign, I will take the courage and the kindness, the warmth, the strength, the resolve of this community with me, and I will share it with the rest of the country. Because we and El Paso, and I hope that we as Americans, still believe that though we have not realized the idea of America for everyone, it is still within our grasp, and we the people of the border can lead the way.

 

Thank you all for coming out here today. Thank you for what you do. [cheers and applause] So grateful to be with you. Gracias. Thank you all very, very much. Thank you. [applause] Thank you all.",24057,82,23974,10.088181293475138,1

Serious question: how do we fix the mess we’re in? I’m scared for my future.,"I swear I’m almost at the point of giving up. It’s not worth it any more. It seems like the president and the rest of the right-wing in this country has spent their time the last few years more as wrecking balls than politicians. They haven’t worked to improve or positively advance policy (which is what I believe any politician should do regardless of affiliation), they’ve just made a point to destroy every little inch forward liberal voters and politicians have made. 

Let’s be honest, to rebuild is going to take way longer than it took to destroy. With the rise of far-right individuals increasingly coming in to power, I fear that it’s too late- we can’t ever achieve a string of liberal or democratic politicians in power long enough to bring us back to where we were before, or further. 

I’m taking things like the environment, which we’re not going to save in time because the political establishment doesn’t give half a damn. I’m talking the basic human rights violations on the border. I’m talking major election fraud and corruption. It’s just going to get worse.

I’m wondering what other liberal people think about these ideas that the US can somehow or should even try to fix Central and South American countries’ problems. Is that imperialist or is it worth trying?",1128,118,1009,7.028201432058005,1
IAAF agent 'asked Qatari royal' for $5m in bid for sporting events,"

   Leaked emails appear to link a member of the Qatari royal family to a deal   that is being investigated as part of a inquiry into alleged corruption   surrounding bids for the 2017 athletics world championships and   2020 Olympic Games.

French investigators have spent three years   scrutinising two payments of $3.5m made in October and November 2011, a month   before a vote by the International Association   of Athletics Federations (IAAF) to decide the host of the 2017   world championships. French investigators suspect the payments may have been   a bribe to win votes for Qatar for the event, which was eventually won by   London.

Emails seen by the Guardian and the French   website Mediapart, which are not in the French police file, suggest that the   disgraced IAAF marketing consultant Papa Massata Diack discussed a transfer   of money in emails to an account run by Sheikh Khalid bin Khalifa Al-Thani,   just before the $3.5m payments were made. Al-Thani is a member of the royal   family and chief of staff to Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, who was then the crown   prince and heir to the throne and became the emir of Qatar in 2013.

Massata Diack, who is wanted by Interpol on   corruption charges, begins one email to “Sheikh Khalid” by telling him:   “Thanks again for your hospitality and diligence during my stay in Doha,”   before providing his IAAF letter of affirmation that “QSI or Oryx QSI” is   asking.  
 

  “I do not owe it to them but to Your HH and yourself as you only know the   role I play in this matter,” he adds. HH appears to refer to Tamim Al Thani,   who was known as HH Heir Apparent when the letter was written in 2011.  
 

  The Guardian, which published part of this letter in 2014, has seen   evidence that points to “Sheikh Khalid” being the chief of staff to the then   crown prince, based on an analysis with Mediapart of dozens of other emails   sent to the same Hotmail account, some of which use Sheikh Khalid bin Khalifa   Al-Thani’s full name in Arabic.

In the email Massata Diack says: “You will   find attached the bank details for the transfer of $4.5 million which must be   done as agreed.” In red ink he then adds: “The balance of 440,000 must remain   in Doha in cash, I will pick it up the next time I come.”  
 

  Papa Massata Diack specifies that the payment must be made “urgently today so   that I can finalize things with the president” and show him “the signed   contract and the bank confirmation”.  
 

  The “president” in question appears to be his father Lamine, who was at the   time the IAAF president. Papa Massata Diack and Lamine Diack were this   week ordered to stand trial on charges of corruption and money   laundering by French authorities. They are accused of being part of a   conspiracy to bury positive drug tests by Russian athletes in   return for money. They all deny the charges.

As for the contract, it is believed to be   between Massata Diack’s company Pamodzi and Oryx QSI, the company headed by a   brother of Nasser al-Khelaifi, the president of Paris Saint-Germain football   club and BeIN Sports.  
 

  Seven days later, Oryx QSI made a $3m transfer to Pamodzi. A second one of   $500,000 followed on 7 November 2011.

Neither Al-Thani or Al Thani responded to   the request for comment from the Guardian and Mediapart. Lamine Diack’s   lawyer also said he did not want to answer any questions before his case was   heard.  
 

  Massata Diack also refused to respond directly when quizzed over the payment.   However after confirming the weather was pleasant in Senegal he added: “It is   better to see you and the French judges your ultimate bosses – in courts – to   get to the bottom of it!!! The investigation is over and if you are sure of   your proofs, just present them there.”  
 

  This latest development, coming after the former Uefa president Michel   Platini was arrested as part of a police corruption probe into the awarding   of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar, will increase the scrutiny on how the country   has tried to acquire major sporting events.  
 

  Al-Khelaifi and his right-hand man Yousef al-Obaidly, the chief executive of   BeIN Sports, two of the most senior figures in sport, are facing “active   corruption” charges related to the $3.5m payment. They have been declared   “mise en examen”, which they are now suspects in the case rather than a   witness.  
 

  Al-Khelaifi denies all allegations. Al-Obaidly also denies any suggestion of   corruption. His representatives insist that the $3.5m wire transfers were a   “non-refundable deposit” by a private company Oryx QSI to Pamodzi Sports   Marketing, owned by the IAAF’s appointed agent, Massata Diack, and not to   Massata Diack directly. They say this was part of a wider $32.6m bid for   athletics TV rights that was dependent on Qatar winning the rights to hold   the 2017 world championships.  
 

  Nasser Al-Khelaifi was also recently asked in court about his connection to   the bids for the 2017 world athletics championships and the 2020 Olympics. “I   did not deal at all with the negotiations for the World Championships in   Athletics or for the Olympic Games,” he told the investigating judge, Renaud   van Ruymbeke, in a transcript seen by the Guardian. “For these events, there   is an organising committee in which I am not a stakeholder.”  
 

  However several documents sent from the Hotmail address used by Nasser   Al-Khelaifi as part of a previously unreported five-man “brain trust” \[sic\]   tasked with helping the then crown prince, “brain storm strategies and   coordinate efforts” to win the 2017 championships and the 2020 Olympics.  
 

  Other emails suggest Al-Khelaifi’s willingness to use his role as boss of Al   Jazeera Sports – which later changed its name to BeIN Sports – to help Qatar   win the 2017 World Athletics Championships.  
 

  A confidential letter sent on 26 June 2011 to him by Saoud al-Thani – the   general secretary of the Qatari Olympic Committee and chairman of the 2017   World Championships bidding committee – asks him to “support the event” by   buying the TV rights for the 2017 world athletics championships, as well as   the rights of the other IAAF competitions for 2014-2019.  
 

  A week later, Al-Khelaifi responds that he accepts all the requests, adding   that Al Jazeera Sports “is very pleased to be part of the Team of the Doha   2017 IAAF World Championship Bid Committee and working closely toward the   success of this event in Qatar”.  
 

  Al-Khelaifi did not respond to questions sent by the Guardian and Mediapart.   His lawyer added: “Mr Al Khelaifi only answers to the judges. He has nothing   to declare to you and regrets the violation \[of the confidentiality\] of the   probe.”",Liberal,danielle_doll,0,1,2019-06-28,299,"IAAF agent 'asked Qatari royal' for $5m in bid for sporting events

New Presidential Poll,"Hello Reddit!

I am looking to make a new poll for the 2020 presidential election. People across all sides of the political spectrums are annoyed with the major polling organisations because they can have special interests, only poll certain people, or do not weight every response the same. While I understand why these organisations weigh age groups according to the previous election demographics there are issues with these polls. A lot of people will look at these polls and believe that say 35% for one candidate means that 35% of Americans want that candidate, it means that 35% of potential voters according to the last elections demographics want that candidate. 

My new poll aims to fix this. I want to get every possible person to answer these polls and make sure that every vote is weighed equally. The best way for this to work is for everyone to answer honestly, share, and answer the poll once.  Thank you in advance, this will be a weekly poll. 

Mine will be run independently, free of influence from companies and other people. If you ever want proof of my results I am always willing to do that. For now the polls are on google but I hope to eventually have a cleaner website.

Why I support Bernie Sanders.,"Establishment centrist run of the mill type politician democrat is the most hated type of democrat by people in the red states so why would we pick that type of candidate to try to get their vote?

Since red states have a lot of poor working class people having a Democrat who wants to raise the minimum wage to a living wage, save them from having to face bankruptcy because they can’t pay medical bills, not have them live in a dirty polluted environment and give their children taxpayer paid college so they won’t have to pay for it for the rest of their lives is far better an option to try to get them on our side.

He also is more likely to get people who voted for Trump to vote for him. There are 3 main reasons for this;

1. He doesn’t automatically see them as bad people. 

He knows very well that there’s people who voted for Trump simply because they’re bigots but he also knows that in a system that favors the rich a lot of people would rather choose a human recking ball then someone who would have kept everything the same despite the growing wealth inequality.

2. He doesn’t just talk the talk on helping working people like Trump no instead he has repeatedly walked the walk and not to mention he talks the talk better too.

He has a history of helping working people he has marched with workers when Trump was feeding his ego with his money and when he’s talking he always talks about substantive real issues that affect working people.

3. He is willing to go to the other side and tell them his policies that only get popular overtime.

 He had been on Fox News showing his willingness to try to convince others of his beliefs that most if not all centrist Democrats who are running wouldn’t be willing to speak to.

Now on to the socialist issue. Obama was called a socialist, Hillary Clinton was called a socialist, no matter what we’re gonna be called socialists and now in 2019 it’s not as effective to simply call someone a socialist.

The history of calling of a democrat a socialist is a lot like how hearing someone curse is. At the first time it’s shocking but as you mature it’s said so much that it gradually loses it’s taboo and eventually only grandmas are shocked when they hear it.

Family Matters.. how to deal with being the outsider advice request?,"This is incredibly long I’m so sorry I’m just at my wits end and need someway to cope with my family’s political leanings. Mobile user Sorry. TLDR at end. 

I recently graduated undergrad and am living back at home. My mom is American white 13th generation in America and my dad is Chinese 3rd generation. He’s got old school racism, really classy name calling and Ching Chang and thought he knew Kung fu type racism. When I would visit home from college, I realized my new found political savvy and what I believed was not reflected at home. They are more conservative leaning and I’m pretty sure he voted for Trump in the last election for his ‘business skills’ whereas I would never vote for Trump because he’s fundamentally an awful human being and he def doesn’t have any business skills. 

Anyway... Problem #1. I’m beginning to think my mom thinks I hate her for being white because my sister and I make a lot of white people jokes or references memes about it since that’s just popular culture. Dunno what to do about this. 

Problem #2 the other day my dad got mad because a tv show had a scene where a black character got mad at a white character and (I didn’t see the scene) but hearing their comments made me think the tv show was calling out white privilege as is popular culture. And my dad got mad because it was unnecessarily political and “why do they have to hate on white people for being white”. yep. So I jokingly say ‘shut up’ and yes this was wrong because they’re sensitive. My mom joins in and says hey he experienced racism and if he wants to have his opinion that they shouldn’t hate on white people then let him. I try to explain that’s not what the show is probably doing (again I referred to the fact that I didn’t see the scene) but that it is annoying that that’s how they perceive it because that means they don’t really understand the problem and they’re just trying to be the victims. 

I’m conflicted and angry because I feel as if their political stances are going against everything I was taught by them to value. Being kind to others and sympathetic and sharing and all that apparent bullshit is just stuff we say to kids and we don’t actually act on those beliefs. Whereas, I feel as if I actually am embodying those beliefs with my political leanings since I think we should have universal healthcare and higher wages and allll this liberal party beliefs. 

The only saving grace is that they believe in climate change thank god. And vaccines. 

I wish there was someway for them to understand why I lean politically the way I do. They’ve made some progress like stopped calling me a snowflake but my mom still brings generational matters into the conversation all the time. I wish they thought the way I do so we could get along and I’m sure they wished the same. I don’t want to just avoid the topic since that’s just ignoring the issue.

Proud to be an American,"Today is the 4th of July and no matter what social injustices that are happening, I can say that I am proud to be an American. I am lucky to live in the country that I do. A lot of people in this world aren't as fortunate. I'm lucky to have been born in the great USA. 

We haven't always had the freedom we are celebrating today. We came here and slaughtered innocent people for the land we now have. We killed children in order to secure our ""freedom"". But that's not who we are anymore. That's not who the people coming into our country are. The PEOPLE coming into this country aren't trying to kill your children, or ""take"" your jobs. They are seeking freedom, just as we did 400 years ago. 

Not everyone is so lucky. There are people out there suffering, people who dream of finding a better life here. I can only imagine the suffering someone must be going through where they would risk the lives of their family. I mean, I would do anything for mine. I would die for them.

But just because it's the law doesn't mean it's right. Say it with me again, JUST BECAUSE IT'S THE LAW DOESN'T MEAN IT'S RIGHT. I mean we treat our rapists and murderers better than the human beings being held at border camps. 

So let me end with this... Growing up I had a hard time feeling proud to be an American. Mostly because of my race, but at the end of the day our ancestors don't define who we are. YOU define who you are and what you stand for. 

So today and every day I am proud to be an American and to be able to live in this beautiful country that I call home, and I also know that we can do better. We ARE better. I can only dream to live in a world where there are no prejudices, one where we take care of one another, and where we can be comfortable in our own skin.

Capitalism is liberal.,"Capitalism is by definition one of the most liberal concepts we have. It is directly modeled off of evolution. It is evolution applied to economics.

&amp;#x200B;

In it's very nature capitalism is about innovation and new ideas. Capitalism eschews conservatism. If you attempt to artificially conserve an economic system that is the exact opposite of capitalism.

&amp;#x200B;

Bailing out a failing company is the antitheses of capitalism. It would be the same as saving a species that was supposed to die. That is the nature and essence of capitalism and evolution. Things are supposed to die and in their failures we will find a better solution. Businesses and life.

&amp;#x200B;

We can also agree it's in everyone's best interest to remove capitalism from the healthcare system. You can remove the profiteering from healthcare without compromising the rest of the system.

I think we should be arguing that liberals are the true capitalists. We just understand that capitalism doesn't need to be applied to everything.

Boycotts of Nestlé are going around because the chairman made a vague statement.

"What should we focus on *More*, homicides or suicides in the US?","So obviously gun deaths have been on the rise and this is a tricky subject for a lot of people. I’ve read all arguments, both left and right and in between. I’ve read banning them entirely, and the consequences of that, and I’ve also read actually making guns easier to get and consequences of that. 

It got me interested so I looked it up. Now what I’m stating is all factual and I don’t mean to ruffle any feathers. It’s just what I’ve come across. So it seems that Brazil actually has more gun deaths than the United States by a few thousand. That is as of 2016 (https://www.sciencenews.org/article/united-states-and-brazil-top-list-nations-most-gun-deaths). Nearly 90% of their gun deaths are homicide. Then I looked at the US and saw over half of our gun deaths are suicide. And also 80% of the homicides are gang or drug related. This means that only about 10% of all gun deaths are actual murders (I know drug and gang killings are murders, but I mean just civilian killing civilian). So I started wondering if the whole mental health argument was true. I mean I didn’t expect suicide numbers to be that high. About 60% of all gun deaths?? Brazil on the other hand had only 5-8% suicides accounting for gun deaths. 

So the more I looked at it, the more it seemed that Brazil actually had a murder problem. It looks like we kinda just have a mental health problem more than anything. Do you think we could help stop all the shootings and deaths by focusing on mental health? It may stop both the suicides and the killers. And as for the drug and gang violence I think that all falls on the war on drugs. Because Brazil banned guns in 2002 and even after that it saw a continuous rise in gun deaths (murders). 

Obviously I’m on the side of wanting less deaths here. I know some of my points come across somewhat right leaning but they’re just me noticing how large the gap is between Brazil and the US and how many suicides we have in comparison to non drug related murders.",Liberal,qdolobp,0,1,2019-07-17,280,"What should we focus on *More*, homicides or suicides in the US?

TLDR; the genetic code exists in 2 languages and 2 dialects

**Chapter 1: DNA**

If we think of the genetic code as a language; which is largely how it behaves; human biology possess 2 languages, and 2 different dialects.

There exists the code that resides in the DNA, or Deoxyribonucleic acid. This is a long molecule that is composed of a sugar phosphate backbone. Attached to the backbone is any of 4 nitrogenous bases composed of adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). This establishes one language; the ""nucleic"" language.

**Chapter 2: RNA**

The sequence from the DNA is copied into another long molecule; a ribonucleic acid, or RNA. This is essentially the same molecule; however, the sugar contains an extra oxygen atom, and as a result, it uses a uracil (U) instead of a thymine (T). This is represented as a separate dialect from the ""deoxy"" dialect. It carries the exact same sequence in the same language, just with a different letter. The ""Ribo"" dialect.

**Chapter 3: Peptides**

Upon processing of the RNA into a messenger RNA; or mRNA; it is taken to a ribosome. This is a molecular machine that reads the mRNA sequence and brings another RNA molecule; a transfer RNA or tRNA; in proximity to it. Each tRNA maintains two aspects; it binds an amino acid, and it contains a specific 3 base sequence that is to be a mirror match of that sequence on mRNA. The tRNA is structured perfectly for the ribosome to gather the proper tRNA, so that the proper amino acids are put close enough to react and create a peptide bond. The result is a polypeptide that forms a functional protein once it is folded into the proper 3D configuration. This scientific term for this process is literally translation. This establishes the second language; the ""peptide"" language, distinct from the ""nucleic"" language.

**Chapter 4: Proteins**

Alas! We have the proverbial Rosetta Stone! Pictured above (source at bottom) is the nucleic codon to amino acid conversion chart. 

The peptide language consists of 20 letters (Source for the amino acids below). With codons 3 bases long, each amino acid is associated with atleast one sequence including 3 codons telling the ribosome to stop, and one (Met, or methionine) that additionally functions to start translation. 

This polypeptide ""word"" then takes on a structure that allows it to perform a certain function, such as a molecular gateway in the membrane that only allows certain particles to pass (extremely useful in neurophysiology), or a hormone, like insulin. 

Proteins must fold specifically to be functional. Local interactions are due to adjacent amino acids; for example, bases that are hydrophobic (repel water) will form a coil, or an alpha helix. These local interactions are the result of the sequence. These interactions play a crucial role in function; however, they do not exhaustive make a function protein. Another layer of folding is required; tertiary structure. This a more complicated set of folding, and often requires the aid of other proteins, such as chaperones. 

Some proteins also take on quaternary structure, which means that separate polypeptide strings must be folded together in order for function. An example of this is hemoglobin with contains 4 parts. 

It is interesting to note that it is estimated that for every polypeptide sequence that is 250 amino acids long (rather short for a protein; human RNA polymerase is ~37,000 amino acids long), only 1 of those sequences elicits a functional protein in every 10^77  sequences (source provided below).

Ilhan Omar refuses to condemn female genital mutilation. Labels the question as “appalling”.,"Recently,  congresswoman Ilhan Omar was asked to condemn female genital mutilation while at the Muslim Caucus Education Collective’s 2019 Conference.

She responded by saying that the question is “appalling” and that “normal” politicians wouldn’t be asked as frequently as her to condemn Muslim actions. She asked if she should “make a schedule? Does this need to be on repeat every five-minutes.” 

Well of course normal politicians wouldn’t be asked as frequently. They aren’t running under this identity of being a proud Muslim, and representing the Muslim community.

She continued “Should I be, like, so today I forgot to condemn al Qaeda, so here’s the al Qaeda one?” 

This is quite funny coming from someone who considers saying “someone did something”, referring to 9/11, as constantly condemning al Qaeda.

Moreover, if she runs on this platform of being a ‘Muslim’ congresswoman and uses identity politics to get votes, why is she so surprised to be asked questions about the actions of other Muslims?

Globalism is Anglo Saxon ethnocentrism and Liberalism is a cancer for this world,"Examples of Anglo Saxon virtues, that developed locally and are adaptive to Anglo Saxons first and foremost, but Anglo Saxons yet want to export into the whole world are: Free markets, democracy, parlamentarism, multiculturalism, feminism, unhinged technological change, scientism, separation of religion and state, human rights, gay rights

The liberals of today who think they need to liberate the third world from religious fundamentalism, who think Russia needs to be liberated by an undemocratic homophob dictator are the same kind of people psychologically speaking as the Anglo Saxon colonialists who travaled to Africa during colonial times and when encountering the native people thought these Africans are dumb underdeveloped savages that need Jesus, a sewage system and ought to be ridded of their tribal beliefs and customs. The white man's burden, precisely.

White liberals think of non-western people as undeveloped savages who are still closer to the animals, intellectually and morally inferior children, and it's the moral duty of the western liberals people to pass down their superior culture. 

Studies have shown that liberals change their style of language when talking to non-white people, they essentially dumb down, like adults do with children. Conservatives, however make no difference when talking to people about the race of the people they talk to.

I am a Republican. I am open to the other side of ideas,"I am a proud republican.

Pro gun. I believe that people have the right to defend themselves. Simple as that. And 97 percent of mass shootings take place in gun free zones. 3 million people are saved every year by guns, versus 30 thousand dead. Meaning you are 93 times more likely to be saved by a gun.

Pro life. As a society, it is our job to speak for those with no voice. Those who are marginalized. And nobody is marginalized more than the unborn. Life begins at conception. No circumstances (other than the life of the mother being at risk) makes the life of the baby less valuable. 

Immigration: I am totally for immigration. But it has to be legal. There is a process. I do think it should be easier to immigrate, but that does not justify breaking the law. Illegal immigrants should be deported.

Israel: the Jewish people have lived there forever, and Israel has a right to exist. It is okay to criticize the Israeli government. But not to say anything about how the Jewish people are responsible for the actions of the government, or its because they are Jewish that these things happen.

White/male privilege: doesn’t exist. There are no rights not afforded to whites/males not afforded to any other group. If there is, I will stand with you and say it is unjust. But it doesn’t exist

Free speech/religion you have the right to say whatever you want no matter how hateful, unless you directly say something like “go kill _____”  and you have the freedom to exercise your religion in whatever way shape or form you desire as long it it does not harm the physical well being/infringe on the property rights of others. It’s ok for a baker to not make a cake for a gay wedding because it would violate his religious beliefs. (I personally would make the cake)

I love capitalism. If you work you survive. If you don’t you die. That’s how it should be. 

I believe in equal rights and equal treatment for all. But equal access to rights. Not equality of opportunity (because some people are smarter, some are stronger, some are faster. Equal access to rights matters. Not equality of opportunity) and also not equality of outcome.

I am right leaning and I want opinions from the other side.,"To start off I did see another post the other day on this Sub Reddit and this will have a similar premise. But I more want to know what a someone on the left believes, and more specifically why they believe it.  So I am gonna go through a few points that I'm curious about, and explain my view points on them.

I also want to point out because I've never gotten an opinion from a liberal I may not completely understand some points, and I would like if you can explain certain things in more detail. Every time I see something online about liberals it is always a radical liberal, and I want opinions from a more moderate group, radicals on both sides should never be considered what they all are. For example my friend hates liberals because all he ever sees are these radical liberals on the internet(Hes also a radical conservative). I want to show me, and even him that not every person leaning towards the left is like that.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Religion:\*\* The reason I chose this first is because I'm sure most people here can agree with me on this. I believe that religion should stay out of politics. I do not believe that people should have to conform to one persons religions just because, and this is coming from a religious man. I believe basing ones politics on religion is the wrong way to go with this country, and laws should based on science, again this is coming from a Christian  man.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*2nd Amendment:\*\* I would like to know your opinion on guns, and gun control. As well as why you believe what you do. I personally believe that gun control should be reformed, not to be stricter but to just be better(idk how to put that). And for ownership of guns themselves, I believe if you can past a more reformed gun control test then I believe you should only be allowed to carry a PISTOL out in public, and any other gun you own should only  be allowed at gun ranges, and inside your house. I also believe that you should be allowed to defend yourself and others using said gun.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Abortion:\*\* I would like to know your guys takes on abortion. My opinion is that you should be allowed to abort the baby until it is considered alive \*\*BY A SCIENTIST\*\* and I do not think religion should take any part in the law of this. Especially this new case going to the supreme court, I expect the supreme court to uphold Roe V Wade. Now I also want to state I morally do not condone abortion, and would not do it myself, but I do not believe my moral belief in this case should be enforced on others.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Harassment:\*\* I want to know your guys opinions on the definition of harassment. I personally believe harassment is when you repeatedly say or do something after being told not to do said thing by the one you are doing it to. I do not believe calling a woman ""sexy"" should be considered harassment unless it is repeated, in that case I agree it should be considered harassment. (Sexual harassment is different, touching a woman sexually without their consent is just wrong in every way).

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*White/Male Privilege:\*\* I want to know the definition of this word from a left leaner. I personally believe that oppression has dramatically decreased in the U.S. And I believe it is unjust to tell white people or men that they have a privilege among all others. It simply makes people think they have an unfair advantage and it just puts them down. I agree that everyone should have equal rights, including during Marshall Law. I know many here will disagree with me on this opinion but I believe this to be wholeheartedly true.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Hate Speech:\*\* I want to know what you guys consider hate speech. Personally I don't believe in hate speech, this also doesn't mean I condone or agree with rude obnoxious people. I believe they should be called out. I should clarify I more or less don't believe so called hate speech should be illegal.

Have any free speech supporters actually used free speech publicly? Esp those upset with Pope Francis's comment? Don't they realize even the average Joe can get violent over things they don't like to hear (esp involving sacred cows and self-esteem)?,"I should have signed up on reddit and make a comment about it when Pope Francis made it years ago but oh well better late than never.

Several years ago, people were getting quite angry when Pope Francis made a comment right after the Charlie Hedbo incident. He used an example that if a friend insulted his mother, he CANNOT expect the Pope himself to just stand there and take it and it shouldn't be surprising if Francis decides to punch him. Basically the Pope was saying words you say have consequences and esp when it involves something as sensitive as religion, you shouldn't be surprised at the possibility of violence breaking out. 

People thought he was defending the Charlie Hedbo killings. Honestly I was flabbergasted they missed his point. The accusations on the Pope being a supporter of the Charlie Hedbo terrorism and even supporting ISIS and anti-Americanism (and similar comments of that nature) got so ridiculous that the Pope had to make a comment stating that he completely condemns the Charlie Hedbo attack and he completely defends freedom of speech. That people are missing his point (which is expecting painful repercussion INCLUDING physical violence).

Even after that plenty of people esp from Anglo Saxon countries in particular Canada and America still expressed outrage at Pope Francis and were stating the Pope is full of **** because free speech means anyone has the right to say anything...............

So I have to ask HAVE any of these commentators- esp on the internet- ever tried to go into a biker bar and yell out that Hell's Angels are  a bunch of P*****s  fags? Or tried to debate with a redneck from Oklahoma? 

I state that because when I was younger I used to love debating about various topics from religion to dinosaurs and politics. Not only would plenty of debates I took part of get so of course with the other side doing personal attacks and using fallacies....... But no matter how much I tried to be polite and use logic often physical stuff would get involved. In fact as early as 10 seconds into a debate just starting, when I would point out inconsistencies and other flawed logic when it comes to sacred cow subjects like military spending, already I got blitzed and punched. This happened too many times I decided to just avoid religion and sensitive subjects.

But even than I'd learn humans would get so damn rude and depending on how long I insisted on the argument and the flow of it, I'd get punched over stuff as snicker bar. One time I was pointing out why Transformers as a franchise had plenty of flaws but the Transformers fanboy wouldn't listen and was getting pissed. He than brought comment out that ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (which I publicly expressed was my favorite movie at the time) is a stupid Arab, and Arabs look stupid and he literally said ""thats what you look like-stupid!""

I was so pissed because not only is Lawrence of Arabia ABOUT A blonde blue eyed British soldier (and the guy never watched the movie) but WHAT THE **** does Arabs have to do with the debate (which was about Transformers?!!!!)? On top of that I was not an Arab and I was white looking and in addition....... Even if you were losing an argument or couldn't come up with a debate........... That DOESN'T JUSTIFY RACIST ATTACKS esp COMMENTS! 

Luckily this never got physical but I was so shocked because of all things to get VERBALLY AGGRESSIVE about, a Hasbro Toyline and TV cartoon? And to even bring up OFF-TOPIC racial comments including making a completely inaccurate comment attacking a movie hero as with a racist comment towards nonwhite (DESPITE the fact they never watched it because if they did they'd KNOW the leading role is a blonde blue eyed Englishman?!)?!

I could not believe it! But I'd learn even making comments about stuff thats objective with solid evidence could lead to violence. I remember when I was pointing out to a Filipino that Manny the Pac-Man flat out lost a recent fight because he was injured prior to the bout and he wasn't in his best shape (along with his opponent being taller and heavier), I was suddenly punched out of nowhere. I could not believe it because I was a BIG PAC-MAN myself!!!! And boxing isn't exactly a Biblical thing concerning God's commandments right? Nor does it involve Republicans and Democrats? Hell the simple fact Manny lost the fight in a lopsided match and was knocked down several times (almost losing to a TKO in an early round) is ALREADY enough objective proof. Hell Pac-Man himself said on public TV after the fight he should have not slacked off conditioning months prior!

This was the biggest shock because not only did the celebrity this Filipino claimed to be a ""true fan of"" supported my views but it was an outright objective one. The results proved it, various referees and experts across the boxing industry agreed, Manny's coach was criticizing him publicly for his incompetence, and even international news including Filipino TV and a good number of his fans were saying Manny had no chance. So to get HIT really ROCKED my world so much......... 

I gave up on free speech that day. Don't get me started on a thing I saw at a bar months later where two people were arguing over what music to play. One of them ultimately USED his own money to insert into the juke box and the other person suckerpunched him........... And this isn't even about free speech at all technically!

So I have to ask............. People so insistent on their right to speech..... In particular those who were outraged at Pope Francis's comments about expecting a punch for making a ""yo mama"" comment...........

 Do they have any experience in the real world? Have any of them ever tried to burn the Bible in front of a Church or write an article about revealing the recent theft a local bully has done? Have any of them even tried to debate at a bar politely about trivial stuff?

Because honestly as someone who experienced verbal insults and even physical assaults for politely debating, I am just baffled how naive so many people can be esp on reddit and other website in regards to free speech. Esp about Pope Francis's statement (which is just ****ing common sense!)!

I know this comes off as a rant but I had to post it because its as though many people in the modern day West expects people to send them flowers for burning the Torah. I got insulted (often with off-topic bigoted stuff such as racist slurs like white trash) for far less, for stuff as trivia as the Transformer toys and the Bionicle franchise (despite not even arguing but just debating politely and pointing out real flaws quite often I'm even a big fan of said subject such as Randy Couture and am merely pointing out his slip ups!).

Your take on the subject?",Liberal,ArnieLarg,3,0,2019-06-09,318,"Have any free speech supporters actually used free speech publicly? Esp those upset with Pope Francis's comment? Don't they realize even the average Joe can get violent over things they don't like to hear (esp involving sacred cows and self-esteem)? I should have signed up on reddit and make a comment about it when Pope Francis made it years ago but oh well better late than never.

Several years ago, people were getting quite angry when Pope Francis made a comment right after the Charlie Hedbo incident. He used an example that if a friend insulted his mother, he CANNOT expect the Pope himself to just stand there and take it and it shouldn't be surprising if Francis decides to punch him. Basically the Pope was saying words you say have consequences and esp when it involves something as sensitive as religion, you shouldn't be surprised at the possibility of violence breaking out. 

People thought he was defending the Charlie Hedbo killings. Honestly I was flabbergasted they missed his point. The accusations on the Pope being a supporter of the Charlie Hedbo terrorism and even supporting ISIS and anti-Americanism (and similar comments of that nature) got so ridiculous that the Pope had to make a comment stating that he completely condemns the Charlie Hedbo attack and he completely defends freedom of speech.

"Trump's ""Collusion"" is Peanuts Next to All-But-Forgotten Iran-Contra","(This is not a copy/paste)

&amp;#x200B;

""What has been will be again,

what has been done will be done again;

there is nothing new under the sun.""

Ecclesiastes 1:9

&amp;#x200B;

On inauguration day, 1981, Iran released American hostages captured over a year earlier from the US embassy during the Iranian Revolution. The outgoing president, Jimmy Carter, did everything in his power to free those hostages: from diplomacy; to CIA operations; to commando raids; and finally by negotiating the Algiers Accords. Unfortunately for his reelection campaign, few fruits of these efforts ever manifested during his own term. And yet conveniently for Ronald Reagan, his inauguration coincided with the liberation of all remaining hostages. It was as if, just by entering office, he had so impressed Iran that they released the captives without his having to lift a finger.

&amp;#x200B;

If that sounds fishy to you, you're not alone. It sounded fishy to former Ford/Carter NSC member Gary Sick, whom Reagan fired soon after becoming president. Sick wrote an [Op-Ed](https://fas.org/irp/congress/1992_cr/h920205-october-clips.htm) about it in 1991. Abolhassan Banisadr, the president of Iran during that exact period of time, has also [claimed](https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/07/world/bani-sadr-in-us-renews-charges-of-1980-deal.html) that Reagan traded his election for weapons to Iran .

&amp;#x200B;

But before you jump the gun, know that there were not one but two congressional investigations of this issue. The first one was arguably not very thorough, but the [second](https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/13/us/house-inquiry-finds-no-evidence-of-deal-on-hostages-in-1980.html) one interviewed over 240 people and cost a whopping $1.35 Million—2.4 Million in today's dollars. Both concluded the same thing, though: no evidence of collusion.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, let's get back to what we do know for sure. In September of 1980, as the US election was nearing its climax, [Iran was invaded by Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_War). Carter had placed [sanctions](https://iranprimer.usip.org/resource/us-sanctions), including an arms embargo, on the nascent government back when they took US hostages in 1979, and Reagan kept the embargo going. This embargo, alongside conflict with Iraq, and an ongoing policy of [aiding radical Pro-Shia](https://www.lawfareblog.com/iranian-revolution-and-its-legacy-terrorism) terrorist groups, seriously threatened Iran's logistical war-making-capacity—which is to say, Iran was running out of useful stuff to shoot with. It didn't help that they were fighting against a ruthless guy named Saddam Hussein who, not surprisingly for any student of US foreign policy, was being [assisted by the United States](https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/08/26/exclusive-cia-files-prove-america-helped-saddam-as-he-gassed-iran/). Iran was desperate for arms relief, from whoever would offer it.

&amp;#x200B;

To recap: when Reagan took office, the Iranian government had instigated an assault on Tehran's US embassy, captured all of the diplomats, and held them hostage for over a year, while going on to wage war against what was at the time a regional ally of the United States. Any weapons they got their hands on were also likely to fall into the hands of terrorists, with whom the Iranian government eagerly affiliated to launch proxy wars. It's not a stretch to say that Iran could be described as an ""enemy of the American people"". At the very least Reagan declared Iran a [State Sponsor of Terrorism](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/state-sponsors-iran) in Jan 1984.

&amp;#x200B;

And yet soon after taking office, Israeli officials later claimed that Reagan facilitated [illegal shipments of American-made weapons into Iran via Israel](https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/08/world/iran-pipeline-hidden-chapter-special-report-us-said-have-allowed-israel-sell.html). Ostensibly he and Israel were supplying a ""moderate"" Iranian faction in the hopes of a coup against the country's Anti-American wing when the Ayatollah died in the future, but an independent counsel, Lawrence Walsh (a Republican) [determined](https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/walsh/part_i.htm) that arms were funneled to the government of Iran itself, controlled by the Ayatollah, who was decidedly immoderate, and for the time being very much alive. [Walsh's report](https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/walsh/), incidentally, is an eye-opeing read that makes Mueller's report look like a glowing Fox fluff piece in comparison. According to the most reasonable [speculation](https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/08/world/iran-pipeline-hidden-chapter-special-report-us-said-have-allowed-israel-sell.html), Israel's likely motivation was to encourage the US to arm both sides of the war, keeping both countries occupied with each other and off its own back. However, during this time there was no good rationale known to justify the US authorizing such a reckless transfer.

&amp;#x200B;

In 1985 Reagan's official paper trail of selling arms to Iran began (beyond testimony by Israeli officials). This was the same year he began [Operation Staunch](http://www.iran.org/tib/krt/fanning_ch7.htm)—a global initiative to halt arm sales to Iran, in which US diplomats allegedly scolded host countries over the moral failings of arming Iran. 

&amp;#x200B;

In 1985 we also have the details of his first (or second, depending upon what you believe) trade of arms for US hostages. This time it was Hezbollah who had captured Americans, under the guise of numerous other names, in [1984](https://www.umbc.edu/che/tahlessons/pdf/historylabs/Oliver_North_an_faculty:RS13.pdf). Iran facilitated the release of a few of these prisoners, and in return got a few thousand TOW missiles shipped to them over the following [years](https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/walsh/part_i.htm), again, an illegal act which violated the US embargo. The hostage rescues came sporadically, but the shipments didn't end until the scandal blew open in late 1986.

&amp;#x200B;

""We were not trading arms for hostages, nor were we negotiating with terrorists"" Reagan later insisted. And yet according to remembered cabinet memos (many of which were destroyed—more on that later), by December 1985 at the latest, Reagan's advisers, including Caspar Weinberger (Secretary of Defense), and Don Regan (Secretary of the treasury and mastermind behind ""Reaganomics,"") were telling the president that these acts were illegal, and urged him to stop.

&amp;#x200B;

Reagan claimed publicly that the rationale behind this weapons deal was really to arm that mythical pro-US coup of Iranian moderates, but to the [Tower Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_Commission) he admitted the weapons were [traded for the hostages](https://books.google.com/books?id=c12BQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=isbn:9781565840478&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwijnbyvqOfiAhWCu54KHfTMB_oQ6AEIKjAA). Neither story holds water, as unrecorded weapon shipments to Iran predated any hostage-taking by Hezbollah, and some recorded shipments were made without a direct correlation to any hostages being returned—and as pointed out before in the Walsh report, the Israeli hand-offs were effectively made to the state of Ayatollah-controlled Iran. Meanwhile, the alleged targets of this strategic, covert, moderate-arming campaign changed from moderate ""political factions,"" to ""army captains,"" to ""government operatives within Iran.""

&amp;#x200B;

By now the parallels between Iran-Contra and Russiagate should be pretty obvious. But this is just the tip of the iceberg, without even mentioning anything about the *Contra* half of the Iran-Contra Affair.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet despite numerous investigations, subpeonas, and indictments, Reagan emerged unscathed and unimpeached. So, too, did many of his [co-conspirators](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,963668,00.html), most of whom received [pardons](https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/iran/1992/921224-260039.htm) , [immunity](https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/12/opinion/the-price-of-iran-contra-immunity.html) , or had sentences overturned on [appeal](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/951/369/257995/), including Oliver North (NSC member), who was indicted for obstruction of a congressional inquiry and destruction of documents along with John Poindexter (Nat'l Sec. Adviser) who was convicted of five counts of conspiracy, obstruction of justice, perjury, defrauding the government, and the alteration and destruction of evidence.

&amp;#x200B;

""...One of the most important items of new evidence to emerge from the trial was North's eyewitness description of Poindexter's destruction of the presidential covert-action Finding authorizing the November 1985 \[Iranian Weapon\] shipment"" wrote Walsh in his [report](https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/walsh/chap_02.htm), describing Reagan's signed authorization of the weapons deal, destroyed in order to protect the president. But Reagan came out, gave a [speech](https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/05/us/reagan-white-house-transcript-reagan-s-speech-take-full-responsibilty-for-my.html), and within a couple of decades was ensconced as a hero. Thus we return to today, and to those arguing that not impeaching Trump would somehow be a precedent for presidential misconduct.

&amp;#x200B;

Honey, that ship sailed a long time ago. The office of the president is already corrupted, and our elections are already [rigged](https://www.electoralintegrityproject.com/eip-blogs/2017/1/7/its-even-worse-than-the-news-about-north-carolina-american-elections-rank-last-among-all-western-democracies). 

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, Trump is almost certainly a criminal, with [emoluments violations](http://fortune.com/2019/04/30/trumps-emoluments-lawsuit/), [insurance fraud](https://apnews.com/1fefeef4a4e84fa4af6441f4b6d221f0), and [campaign finance violations](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/12/07/government-implicates-trump-trump-campaign-federal-campaign-finance-law-violations/?utm_term=.55aeefc72537) likely under his belt, at least. But he's just another crook in an office with a long history of criminality. From Reagan's Iran-Contra collusion to Bush's WMD [lies](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/3/20/18274228/ari-fleischer-iraq-lies-george-w-bush-wmds), and Obama's [extrajudicial execution](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/legal-memo-backing-drone-strike-is-released/2014/06/23/1f48dd16-faec-11e3-8176-f2c941cf35f1_story.html?utm_term=.0283d53862a7) of the al-Awlakis (something Trump hasn't yet replicated but now has the precedent to do, thanks Obama), Trump is only dangerous because he rests on the precedents set by short-sighted men seizing short-term gains under the auspices of executive privilege. Without correcting that, first and foremost, Trump's removal will mean absolutely nothing. Trump is the gangrene that has set into a sucking chest wound, and acting like some antibiotic alone is going to be a solution without focusing at least as much on essential surgery, at best, naive.

&amp;#x200B;

One more strange line of continuity exists between Reagan and Trump. Elliott Abrams, one of the men responsible for the Contra side of the Iran-Contra affair, and whom Ilhan Omar famously [excoriated](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/02/13/rep_ilhan_omar_challenges_venezuela_envoy_elliott_abrams_about_iran-contra_past.html) over his involvement, is back. Abrams helped to cover up the illegal transfer of arms to the Contras, was convicted for it, and later pardoned.  To a shockingly small amount of consternation, Abrams is now the ambassador to another South American country on the brink of a civil war with US-backed right-wing rebels looking to topple a ""socialist"" regime. Since I didn't get to it here, you'll have to check out Abrams' [Contras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contras) for yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

If one is worried about Trump exercising executive overreach to cause long-lasting harm, history tells us we should examine his relationships with Venezuela and Iran, not Russia. And while we're at it, we should examine the long-lasting harm we already suffer for, at the hands of the presidents who made him.",Liberal,GreenVajene,0,1,2019-06-13,314,"Trump's ""Collusion"" is Peanuts Next to All-But-Forgotten Iran-Contra (This is not a copy/paste)

It didn't help that they were fighting against a ruthless guy named Saddam Hussein who, not surprisingly for any student of US foreign policy, was being [assisted by the United States](https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/08/26/exclusive-cia-files-prove-america-helped-saddam-as-he-gassed-iran/). Iran was desperate for arms relief, from whoever would offer it.

&amp;#x200B;

To recap: when Reagan took office, the Iranian government had instigated an assault on Tehran's US embassy, captured all of the diplomats, and held them hostage for over a year, while going on to wage war against what was at the time a regional ally of the United States. Any weapons they got their hands on were also likely to fall into the hands of terrorists, with whom the Iranian government eagerly affiliated to launch proxy wars. It's not a stretch to say that Iran could be described as an ""enemy of the American people"". At the very least Reagan declared Iran a [State Sponsor of Terrorism](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/state-sponsors-iran) in Jan 1984.

&amp;#x200B;

And yet soon after taking office, Israeli officials later claimed that Reagan facilitated [illegal shipments of American-made weapons into Iran via Israel](https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/08/world/iran-pipeline-hidden-chapter-special-report-us-said-have-allowed-israel-sell.html). Ostensibly he and Israel were supplying a ""moderate"" Iranian faction in the hopes of a coup against the country's Anti-American wing when the Ayatollah died in the future, but an independent counsel, Lawrence Walsh (a Republican) [determined](https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/walsh/part_i.htm) that arms were funneled to the government of Iran itself, controlled by the Ayatollah, who was decidedly immoderate, and for the time being very much alive. [Walsh's report](https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/walsh/), incidentally, is an eye-opeing read that makes Mueller's report look like a glowing Fox fluff piece in comparison. According to the most reasonable [speculation](https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/08/world/iran-pipeline-hidden-chapter-special-report-us-said-have-allowed-israel-sell.html), Israel's likely motivation was to encourage the US to arm both sides of the war, keeping both countries occupied with each other and off its own back. However, during this time there was no good rationale known to justify the US authorizing such a reckless transfer.

&amp;#x200B;

In 1985 Reagan's official paper trail of selling arms to Iran began (beyond testimony by Israeli officials). This was the same year he began [Operation Staunch](http://www.iran.org/tib/krt/fanning_ch7.htm)—a global initiative to halt arm sales to Iran, in which US diplomats allegedly scolded host countries over the moral failings of arming Iran. 

&amp;#x200B;

In 1985 we also have the details of his first (or second, depending upon what you believe) trade of arms for US hostages. This time it was Hezbollah who had captured Americans, under the guise of numerous other names, in [1984](https://www.umbc.edu/che/tahlessons/pdf/historylabs/Oliver_North_an_faculty:RS13.pdf). Iran facilitated the release of a few of these prisoners, and in return got a few thousand TOW missiles shipped to them over the following [years](https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/walsh/part_i.htm), again, an illegal act which violated the US embargo. The hostage rescues came sporadically, but the shipments didn't end until the scandal blew open in late 1986.

&amp;#x200B;

""We were not trading arms for hostages, nor were we negotiating with terrorists"" Reagan later insisted. And yet according to remembered cabinet memos (many of which were destroyed—more on that later), by December 1985 at the latest, Reagan's advisers, including Caspar Weinberger (Secretary of Defense), and Don Regan (Secretary of the treasury and mastermind behind ""Reaganomics,"") were telling the president that these acts were illegal, and urged him to stop.

&amp;#x200B;

Reagan claimed publicly that the rationale behind this weapons deal was really to arm that mythical pro-US coup of Iranian moderates, but to the [Tower Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_Commission) he admitted the weapons were [traded for the hostages](https://books.google.com/books?id=c12BQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=isbn:9781565840478&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwijnbyvqOfiAhWCu54KHfTMB_oQ6AEIKjAA). Neither story holds water, as unrecorded weapon shipments to Iran predated any hostage-taking by Hezbollah, and some recorded shipments were made without a direct correlation to any hostages being returned—and as pointed out before in the Walsh report, the Israeli hand-offs were effectively made to the state of Ayatollah-controlled Iran. Meanwhile, the alleged targets of this strategic, covert, moderate-arming campaign changed from moderate ""political factions,"" to ""army captains,"" to ""government operatives within Iran.""

&amp;#x200B;

By now the parallels between Iran-Contra and Russiagate should be pretty obvious. But this is just the tip of the iceberg, without even mentioning anything about the *Contra* half of the Iran-Contra Affair.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet despite numerous investigations, subpeonas, and indictments, Reagan emerged unscathed and unimpeached. So, too, did many of his [co-conspirators](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,963668,00.html), most of whom received [pardons](https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/iran/1992/921224-260039.htm) , [immunity](https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/12/opinion/the-price-of-iran-contra-immunity.html) , or had sentences overturned on [appeal](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/951/369/257995/), including Oliver North (NSC member), who was indicted for obstruction of a congressional inquiry and destruction of documents along with John Poindexter (Nat'l Sec. Adviser) who was convicted of five counts of conspiracy, obstruction of justice, perjury, defrauding the government, and the alteration and destruction of evidence.

&amp;#x200B;

""...One of the most important items of new evidence to emerge from the trial was North's eyewitness description of Poindexter's destruction of the presidential covert-action Finding authorizing the November 1985 \[Iranian Weapon\] shipment"" wrote Walsh in his [report](https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/walsh/chap_02.htm), describing Reagan's signed authorization of the weapons deal, destroyed in order to protect the president. But Reagan came out, gave a [speech](https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/05/us/reagan-white-house-transcript-reagan-s-speech-take-full-responsibilty-for-my.html), and within a couple of decades was ensconced as a hero. Thus we return to today, and to those arguing that not impeaching Trump would somehow be a precedent for presidential misconduct.

&amp;#x200B;

Honey, that ship sailed a long time ago. The office of the president is already corrupted, and our elections are already [rigged](https://www.electoralintegrityproject.com/eip-blogs/2017/1/7/its-even-worse-than-the-news-about-north-carolina-american-elections-rank-last-among-all-western-democracies). 

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, Trump is almost certainly a criminal, with [emoluments violations](http://fortune.com/2019/04/30/trumps-emoluments-lawsuit/), [insurance fraud](https://apnews.com/1fefeef4a4e84fa4af6441f4b6d221f0), and [campaign finance violations](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/12/07/government-implicates-trump-trump-campaign-federal-campaign-finance-law-violations/?utm_term=.55aeefc72537) likely under his belt, at least. But he's just another crook in an office with a long history of criminality. From Reagan's Iran-Contra collusion to Bush's WMD [lies](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/3/20/18274228/ari-fleischer-iraq-lies-george-w-bush-wmds), and Obama's [extrajudicial execution](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/legal-memo-backing-drone-strike-is-released/2014/06/23/1f48dd16-faec-11e3-8176-f2c941cf35f1_story.html?utm_term=.0283d53862a7) of the al-Awlakis (something Trump hasn't yet replicated but now has the precedent to do, thanks Obama), Trump is only dangerous because he rests on the precedents set by short-sighted men seizing short-term gains under the auspices of executive privilege. Without correcting that, first and foremost, Trump's removal will mean absolutely nothing. Trump is the gangrene that has set into a sucking chest wound, and acting like some antibiotic alone is going to be a solution without focusing at least as much on essential surgery, at best, naive.

&amp;#x200B;

One more strange line of continuity exists between Reagan and Trump. Elliott Abrams, one of the men responsible for the Contra side of the Iran-Contra affair, and whom Ilhan Omar famously [excoriated](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/02/13/rep_ilhan_omar_challenges_venezuela_envoy_elliott_abrams_about_iran-contra_past.html) over his involvement, is back. Abrams helped to cover up the illegal transfer of arms to the Contras, was convicted for it, and later pardoned.  To a shockingly small amount of consternation, Abrams is now the ambassador to another South American country on the brink of a civil war with US-backed right-wing rebels looking to topple a ""socialist"" regime. Since I didn't get to it here, you'll have to check out Abrams' [Contras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contras) for yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

If one is worried about Trump exercising executive overreach to cause long-lasting harm, history tells us we should examine his relationships with Venezuela and Iran, not Russia.

[@NeilTheIdiot](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5d8tmD-Vj7TCPNL6ROLUXQ) The United States has hundreds of military bases all around the world, we are 90% of the strength behind NATO, so no we do not only protect japan. Btw I said crime rates, not homicide rates.

​[@RavagersPrey](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWcdIMsarmnBRscrgqRrZvA) First that is only 3.6% of our GDP and on a percent basis of a nation's GDP we do not have a crazy figure (The Uk spends 2.1% France spends 1.8% and so on)[ https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2018/07/10/defense-expenditure-of-nato-members-visualized-infographic/#18b6c32614cf](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?stzid=UgxbZn289-nUfL6FhK54AaABAg.8_qpFa8awAI8wBPIkyQNag&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fniallmccarthy%2F2018%2F07%2F10%2Fdefense-expenditure-of-nato-members-visualized-infographic%2F%2318b6c32614cf&amp;event=comments&amp;redir_token=2iTcHQ3ZmSpBJuvbnGzeGjLab798MTU2MDc0OTI3M0AxNTYwNjYyODcz)

(Even though many nations do not donate 2% of their GDP it does provide a more accurate representation!)

Second again in the event of world war, nations would use nukes also all Nato nations (Except Japan) have their own military. Third, while I understand crime rates are not homicide rates the two are closely linked and also the apparent rise in rape in Europe does not make sense as the rate is 4% below average and robberies are 57% less than average

[@NeilTheIdiot](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5d8tmD-Vj7TCPNL6ROLUXQ) The US spends almost 700 billion dollars on military, more then the next 10 nations combined europe's military is pathetic in comparison. The only nation in europe that you could call a military power is the UK and they are still dwarfed. Japan does actually have it's own military just not a large one. The US is NATO it's 90% of the power behind it while only using 3.6% of it's gdp you do realize the US is a superpower right?

[@RavagersPrey](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWcdIMsarmnBRscrgqRrZvA) My point wasn't that the amount that the US spends is comparable to the spendings of other nations it is a superpower rather that these countries have a smaller economy but percentage wise they spend close to that of the US military budget. Also, you realize that the US uses it's military for its own interests right. So relatively they spend close to the same percentage of their GDP and so it's not like they don't have to worry about their military.

[RavagersPrey](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWcdIMsarmnBRscrgqRrZvA)

[@NeilTheIdiot](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5d8tmD-Vj7TCPNL6ROLUXQ) Percentage of gdp is pretty irrelevant when you are comparing a nation with a almost 20 trillion dollar gdp to nations that are between 1 and 5 trillion. Without the United States Europe has very little defense.

[@RavagersPrey](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWcdIMsarmnBRscrgqRrZvA) But they have roughly the same amount of their economy left to spend on stuff like health care, and defense against superpowers in 2019 doesn't matter as much because in the event of another world war nukes would be used. The percentage does matter because of a nation with a one trillion dollar GDP has all expenses lower than that of a 20 trillion dollar GDP nation.

[@NeilTheIdiot](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5d8tmD-Vj7TCPNL6ROLUXQ) That's because they spend a lot less on defense the 3.6% gdp is just for NATO, the US spends around 10-13% on military defense. A conflict in europe does not necessarily mean world war 3 and there is no guarantee nukes would be used. All expenses lower? Military equipment does not get cheaper just because you have a smaller economy, europe has far less and spend far less then the united states. You realize only a few nations possess nukes, and the superpowers china, russia, US have about 99% of them. Europe could not compete with a superpower militarily they lack the experience, manpower and money.

[@RavagersPrey](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWcdIMsarmnBRscrgqRrZvA) By all expenses lower I mean generally they have less of a budget for all things infrastructure health care etc. In the case of war just in Europe (or a more local war) then the components would be more evenly matched because if it isn't a world war we can assume no superpowers get involved. Your experience/manpower argument doesn't make sense because first Europe has a fairly high population. Second, how does the US have way more experience than Europe? Additionally does have a decent amount of nukes or at least enough to cause a lot of harm, for example, the U.K has 215 nuclear warheads in total. You are right the US does spend 15.876% of its budget on the military which is larger than many countries but most countries budgets are closer to that of the average nation of Europe. Additionally, due to alliances, a war with Russia or China (Just Examples) would draw way more nations in so a fight wouldn't be one on one. Also, the chances of a large conflict nowadays are very low so there is less of a need for a huge military.

[RavagersPrey](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWcdIMsarmnBRscrgqRrZvA)

[@NeilTheIdiot](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5d8tmD-Vj7TCPNL6ROLUXQ) Superpowers can be in wars that aren't world wars, the us has more experience then europe because the us is always ready for war or involved in some kind of conflict while europe hides behind it. The superpowers have the ability to shoot down nukes and 215 nukes is pathetic compared to the total amount. The only nation even coming close to the US military budget is china and even then it's not even half, the US budget is not just larger then many of them, it's larger then all of them. China and russia have few allies and are not well liked in general what allies could they bring to the fold exactly? If there's one certainty in this world is that conflict will happen eventually not preparing for it, is foolish.

​[@RavagersPrey](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWcdIMsarmnBRscrgqRrZvA)First my point was if a superpower was to get involved in a war with something like Nato (Which are the only nations that are guaranteed by the US and therefore are the only nations that apply for your less military spending because of the US's military in Europe) then it would be a world war Second 215 nukes would cause a lot of damage (don't believe me check out this article[ https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2018/06/13/100-warheads-enough-cause-starvation-nuclear-autumn/)](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?stzid=UgxbZn289-nUfL6FhK54AaABAg.8_qpFa8awAI8wE4-zad1sN&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Fscience%2F2018%2F06%2F13%2F100-warheads-enough-cause-starvation-nuclear-autumn%2F%29&amp;event=comments&amp;redir_token=2iTcHQ3ZmSpBJuvbnGzeGjLab798MTU2MDc0OTI3M0AxNTYwNjYyODcz) Also for you point on large scale wars being inevitable while you are partially right one day there will probably be a war the threat of a nuclear holocaust and the Doctrine of mad has reduced the chance of superpowers going head to head. Also deflecting nukes on the scale of several hundred is improbable. Therefore a world war 3 is unlikely for the meantime which means that any wars would be on a far more local level which an average size military could deal with while still having money for social programs.

[@NeilTheIdiot](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5d8tmD-Vj7TCPNL6ROLUXQ) The United States has hundreds of military bases all around the world, we are 90% of the strength behind NATO, so no we do not only protect japan. Btw I said crime rates, not homicide rates.

[NeilTheIdiot](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5d8tmD-Vj7TCPNL6ROLUXQ)[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPI0UwHGp3M&amp;lc=UgxbZn289-nUfL6FhK54AaABAg.8_qpFa8awAI8wBPIkyQNag)

​[@RavagersPrey](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWcdIMsarmnBRscrgqRrZvA) First that is only 3.6% of our GDP and on a percent basis of a nation's GDP we do not have a crazy figure (The Uk spends 2.1% France spends 1.8% and so on)[ https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2018/07/10/defense-expenditure-of-nato-members-visualized-infographic/#18b6c32614cf](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?stzid=UgxbZn289-nUfL6FhK54AaABAg.8_qpFa8awAI8wBPIkyQNag&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fniallmccarthy%2F2018%2F07%2F10%2Fdefense-expenditure-of-nato-members-visualized-infographic%2F%2318b6c32614cf&amp;event=comments&amp;redir_token=2iTcHQ3ZmSpBJuvbnGzeGjLab798MTU2MDc0OTI3M0AxNTYwNjYyODcz)

(Even though many nations do not donate 2% of their GDP it does provide a more accurate representation!)

Second again in the event of world war, nations would use nukes also all Nato nations (Except Japan) have their own military. Third, while I understand crime rates are not homicide rates the two are closely linked and also the apparent rise in rape in Europe does not make sense as the rate is 4% below average and robberies are 57% less than average

[@NeilTheIdiot](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5d8tmD-Vj7TCPNL6ROLUXQ) The US spends almost 700 billion dollars on military, more then the next 10 nations combined europe's military is pathetic in comparison. The only nation in europe that you could call a military power is the UK and they are still dwarfed. Japan does actually have it's own military just not a large one. The US is NATO it's 90% of the power behind it while only using 3.6% of it's gdp you do realize the US is a superpower right?

[@RavagersPrey](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWcdIMsarmnBRscrgqRrZvA) My point wasn't that the amount that the US spends is comparable to the spendings of other nations it is a superpower rather that these countries have a smaller economy but percentage wise they spend close to that of the US military budget. Also, you realize that the US uses it's military for its own interests right. So relatively they spend close to the same percentage of their GDP and so it's not like they don't have to worry about their military.

[RavagersPrey](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWcdIMsarmnBRscrgqRrZvA)

[@NeilTheIdiot](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5d8tmD-Vj7TCPNL6ROLUXQ) Percentage of gdp is pretty irrelevant when you are comparing a nation with a almost 20 trillion dollar gdp to nations that are between 1 and 5 trillion. Without the United States Europe has very little defense.

[@RavagersPrey](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWcdIMsarmnBRscrgqRrZvA) But they have roughly the same amount of their economy left to spend on stuff like health care, and defense against superpowers in 2019 doesn't matter as much because in the event of another world war nukes would be used. The percentage does matter because of a nation with a one trillion dollar GDP has all expenses lower than that of a 20 trillion dollar GDP nation.

[@NeilTheIdiot](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5d8tmD-Vj7TCPNL6ROLUXQ) That's because they spend a lot less on defense the 3.6% gdp is just for NATO, the US spends around 10-13% on military defense. A conflict in europe does not necessarily mean world war 3 and there is no guarantee nukes would be used. All expenses lower? Military equipment does not get cheaper just because you have a smaller economy, europe has far less and spend far less then the united states. You realize only a few nations possess nukes, and the superpowers china, russia, US have about 99% of them. Europe could not compete with a superpower militarily they lack the experience, manpower and money.

[NeilTheIdiot](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5d8tmD-Vj7TCPNL6ROLUXQ)

[@RavagersPrey](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWcdIMsarmnBRscrgqRrZvA) By all expenses lower I mean generally they have less of a budget for all things infrastructure health care etc. In the case of war just in Europe (or a more local war) then the components would be more evenly matched because if it isn't a world war we can assume no superpowers get involved. Your experience/manpower argument doesn't make sense because first Europe has a fairly high population. Second, how does the US have way more experience than Europe? Additionally does have a decent amount of nukes or at least enough to cause a lot of harm, for example, the U.K has 215 nuclear warheads in total. You are right the US does spend 15.876% of its budget on the military which is larger than many countries but most countries budgets are closer to that of the average nation of Europe. Additionally, due to alliances, a war with Russia or China (Just Examples) would draw way more nations in so a fight wouldn't be one on one. Also, the chances of a large conflict nowadays are very low so there is less of a need for a huge military.

[RavagersPrey](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWcdIMsarmnBRscrgqRrZvA)

[@NeilTheIdiot](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5d8tmD-Vj7TCPNL6ROLUXQ) Superpowers can be in wars that aren't world wars, the us has more experience then europe because the us is always ready for war or involved in some kind of conflict while europe hides behind it. The superpowers have the ability to shoot down nukes and 215 nukes is pathetic compared to the total amount. The only nation even coming close to the US military budget is china and even then it's not even half, the US budget is not just larger then many of them, it's larger then all of them. China and russia have few allies and are not well liked in general what allies could they bring to the fold exactly? If there's one certainty in this world is that conflict will happen eventually not preparing for it, is foolish.

​[@RavagersPrey](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWcdIMsarmnBRscrgqRrZvA)First my point was if a superpower was to get involved in a war with something like Nato (Which are the only nations that are guaranteed by the US and therefore are the only nations that apply for your less military spending because of the US's military in Europe) then it would be a world war Second 215 nukes would cause a lot of damage (don't believe me check out this article[ https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2018/06/13/100-warheads-enough-cause-starvation-nuclear-autumn/)](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?stzid=UgxbZn289-nUfL6FhK54AaABAg.8_qpFa8awAI8wE4-zad1sN&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Fscience%2F2018%2F06%2F13%2F100-warheads-enough-cause-starvation-nuclear-autumn%2F%29&amp;event=comments&amp;redir_token=2iTcHQ3ZmSpBJuvbnGzeGjLab798MTU2MDc0OTI3M0AxNTYwNjYyODcz) Also for you point on large scale wars being inevitable while you are partially right one day there will probably be a war the threat of a nuclear holocaust and the Doctrine of mad has reduced the chance of superpowers going head to head. Also deflecting nukes on the scale of several hundred is improbable. Therefore a world war 3 is unlikely for the meantime which means that any wars would be on a far more local level which an average size military could deal with while still having money for social programs.

Charisma is a better predictor of elections than actual policies,"It is clear to me that we need to pick the Democrat primary candidate with the most charisma.  Charisma is a better predictor of elections than actual policy!

Reagan, in spite of being a terrible president, had a lot of charisma and won in a landslide twice!

Obama has a LOT of charisma, and won the presidency in an electoral landslide. But there is very little difference between Obama’s policies and the ones proposed by Hillary Clinton!  (Links below).   

Yet one of them won by a landslide, and the other lost, with virtually the same policies!   So what was the difference?   Charisma!

I just spent the last few hours reading through conservative and far-right message boards. It's too disturbing for words.,"I thought I was familiar with the alt-right's lunacy, but reading through their message boards today puts into perspective how dangerous they are. I'm legitimately baffled by some of the stuff I read today.

They all seem to be waiting for the excuse to start killing people. They seem to want a civil war. They actively talk about sieges, battle tactics, and how to deal with leftists when the fighting breaks out. They detail how the southern states will drive the armies in the coastal cities towards the sea, pin them against the shore and annihilate them. One person talked about killing everyone who isn't a conservative Christian. From reading the comments it seems like a large amount of semi-normal conservatives are starting to lean into extremist views and ideologies. It's spreading.

The thing that makes this all the more scary is that they legitimately think they are victims who need to defend and preserve something. They think they are warriors who will be martyred after they die ""fighting for America"". Their personalities are rooted in ""white identity"" or ""Proud American"" and they are ready to kill the people they perceive as threats. They think the Dems want open borders because it's a Jewish conspiracy to replace the white race and put brown people in power.

This scares me. These people terrify me. There's so many of them and they all plot and plan in their corners of the internet. Many of them are armed and would probably actually kill given the excuse. We've seen the rise in white supremacist hate crimes and it doesn't seem to be getting better. These are terrorists in the making.",Liberal,HayleyKJ,193,275,2019-05-03,355,"I just spent the last few hours reading through conservative and far-right message boards. It's too disturbing for words.

Why do liberals think Trump supporters are stupid,"This is going around so I thought I would share it here                                                                      Authors name at the bottom       

An anguished question from a Trump supporter: ""Why do liberals think Trump supporters are stupid?""

The serious answer: Here’s what we really think about Trump supporters - the rich, the poor, the malignant and the innocently well-meaning, the ones who think and the ones who don't...

That when you saw a man who had owned a fraudulent University, intent on scamming poor people, you thought ""Fine.""

That when you saw a man who had made it his business practice to stiff his creditors, you said, ""Okay.""

That when you heard him proudly brag about his own history of sexual abuse, you said, ""No problem.""

That when he made up stories about seeing muslim-Americans in the thousands cheering the destruction of the World Trade Center, you said, ""Not an issue.""

That when you saw him brag that he could shoot a man on Fifth Avenue and you wouldn't care, you chirped, ""He sure knows me.""

That when you heard him illustrate his own character by telling that cute story about the elderly guest bleeding on the floor at his country club, the story about how he turned his back and how it was all an imposition on him, you said, ""That's cool!""

That when you saw him mock the disabled, you thought it was the funniest thing you ever saw.

That when you heard him brag that he doesn't read books, you said, ""Well, who has time?""

That when the Central Park Five were compensated as innocent men convicted of a crime they didn't commit, and he angrily said that they should still be in prison, you said, ""That makes sense.""

That when you heard him tell his supporters to beat up protesters and that he would hire attorneys, you thought, ""Yes!""

That when you heard him tell one rally to confiscate a man's coat before throwing him out into the freezing cold, you said, ""What a great guy!""

That you have watched the parade of neo-Nazis and white supremacists with whom he curries favor, while refusing to condemn outright Nazis, and you have said, ""Thumbs up!""

That you hear him unable to talk to foreign dignitaries without insulting their countries and demanding that they praise his electoral win, you said, ""That's the way I want my President to be.""

That you have watched him remove expertise from all layers of government in favor of people who make money off of eliminating protections in the industries they're supposed to be regulating and you have said, ""What a genius!""

That you have heard him continue to profit from his businesses, in part by leveraging his position as President, to the point of overcharging the Secret Service for space in the properties he owns, and you have said, ""That's smart!""

That you have heard him say that it was difficult to help Puerto Rico because it was the middle of water and you have said, ""That makes sense.""

The serious answer: Here’s what we really think about Trump supporters - the rich, the poor, the malignant and the innocently well-meaning, the ones who think and the ones who don't...

That when you saw a man who had owned a fraudulent University, intent on scamming poor people, you thought ""Fine.""

That when you saw a man who had made it his business practice to stiff his creditors, you said, ""Okay.""

That when you heard him proudly brag about his own history of sexual abuse, you said, ""No problem.""

That when he made up stories about seeing muslim-Americans in the thousands cheering the destruction of the World Trade Center, you said, ""Not an issue.""

That when you saw him brag that he could shoot a man on Fifth Avenue and you wouldn't care, you chirped, ""He sure knows me.""

That when you heard him illustrate his own character by telling that cute story about the elderly guest bleeding on the floor at his country club, the story about how he turned his back and how it was all an imposition on him, you said, ""That's cool!""

That when you saw him mock the disabled, you thought it was the funniest thing you ever saw.

That when you heard him brag that he doesn't read books, you said, ""Well, who has time?""

That when the Central Park Five were compensated as innocent men convicted of a crime they didn't commit, and he angrily said that they should still be in prison, you said, ""That makes sense.""

That when you heard him tell his supporters to beat up protesters and that he would hire attorneys, you thought, ""Yes!""

That when you heard him tell one rally to confiscate a man's coat before throwing him out into the freezing cold, you said, ""What a great guy!""

That you have watched the parade of neo-Nazis and white supremacists with whom he curries favor, while refusing to condemn outright Nazis, and you have said, ""Thumbs up!""

That you hear him unable to talk to foreign dignitaries without insulting their countries and demanding that they praise his electoral win, you said, ""That's the way I want my President to be.""

That you have watched him remove expertise from all layers of government in favor of people who make money off of eliminating protections in the industries they're supposed to be regulating and you have said, ""What a genius!""

That you have heard him continue to profit from his businesses, in part by leveraging his position as President, to the point of overcharging the Secret Service for space in the properties he owns, and you have said, ""That's smart!""

That you have heard him say that it was difficult to help Puerto Rico because it was the middle of water and you have said, ""That makes sense.""

That you have seen him start fights with every country from Canada to New Zealand while praising Russia and quote, ""falling in love"" with the dictator of North Korea, and you have said, ""That's statesmanship!""

I am new to this subreddit (and reddit in general) and, in wake of so many states outlawing abortion, want to remind people Plan B does not need a prescription and if you can get a prescription it is covered at least partially on most insurances. You can get it from the pharmacy and if they have it in stock they will sell it to you no questions asked. For people wanting to help, stocking up on Plan B and mailing it to someone who cannot get one (whether for monetary reason or legal reasons), although not particularly legal, is hard for law enforcement to enforce and with modern technology, is pretty easy to achieve. Feel free to DM me with any questions.

&amp;#x200B;

I also want to spread the word of a FaceBook group called ""The Auntie Network"" which is a group that is centered providing safe spaces for people looking for legal abortions, getting away from abuse, etc. There are people from all over the US willing to provide housing, food, transportation, support, and friendship for people who need to go to a safe space. If you are interested in providing a safe space or need a safe space, I would highly recommend checking that group out.

We cannot support the vast increase in rent-seeking behavior,"Among economists, ""rent-seeking behavior"" is when someone seeks to get payments from you at regular intervals. The most common form of this is from landlords. They would charge you twice a month if they could; since they can't, they simply charge you as much as you can possibly afford. There is no rational reason for rents to be as high as they are, while wages are so low. Rent is supposed to be around 30% of your income.


Meanwhile, many other providers of goods and services have laid aside the notion of selling you something once in favor of selling it to you over and over, month after month. Or even, god help us, selling it to you once AND renting it to you thereafter. 


Television used to be free, paid for by a few minutes of commercials per hour. Then cable came along, promising to do away with those annoying commercials for a monthly fee. That was cool for awhile, then the cable companies got greedy and the commercials started creeping in again. Now they have you paying a ridiculous amount of money and there are more commercials than ever before. The programs, meanwhile, are fluffed out so badly that the ratio of actual content to time spent watching is pathetic.


So then you get the streaming services. That was cool for awhile; then other content providers that used to be free start seeking rent too. Meanwhile, all the streaming services start offering less and less of any real value to see how little they can offer you and still get that monthly rent.  So now we pay for Netflix, Hulu, Prime, and there's still barely anything good on.  Those few shows that are good are only making ten shows A YEAR. 


Then you have your electric bill, water bill (landlords used to pay that), ISP payment, phone bill, car payment, car insurance payment, health insurance payment, childcare, grocery bills, student loan payments, and who knows what else.


Software that you used to simply buy and use, is now kept in the cloud and charges monthly rent. Amazon has just made a deal with Apple not to sell iPhones refurbished by anyone except for licensed Apple dealers/refurbishers.


We are fighting to raise the minimum wage to $15, and they are actually fighting back! $15 is already inadequate in the states where it's been passed; by the time it's the minimum wage everywhere, it will be laughably far away from anything like a living wage. Meanwhile, these unbearably greedy corporations -- the same ones that will not pay us a living wage -- hardly even pay any taxes.

In defense of open free conversation.,"In my youth I was a very different person. I was a devout Catholic and followed the dictates of the Church. This meant I was anti-abortion, I had a fairly archaic view of gender relationships and roles. Same sex marriage was definite NO. Marriage was between a man and woman, and you had to have children... the list goes on. At university in a feminist class I said something embarrassingly male, to the tune of, 'the only reason feminism exists is because men allow it.' 

Anyway today I hold none of these views, my entire perspective has shifted. But if I held these views as a young Catholic today, my mind would never have been changed. Why? I would not have been allowed to express my views in pro-liberal spaces... I would have been called a sexist and told to shut up, or get lost, or worse. And to be clear I was sexist, but I wasn't called sexist/homophobic, or hateful, or anything of that sort. Even though I absolutely was?

That pro-liberal space instead did something I found so interesting that I was hooked in hard. It asked me to defend my positions with argument and discussion. We then as a group, me a male sitting at a table with a bunch of women, went through those arguments. We deconstructed them, I was introduced to counter arguments (This was my feminist reading group at university), and my mind began to change.

On everything, now I am pro-choice, sort same sex marriage... the works.

But what I cannot support is this sub's refusal to allow a sexist viewpoint to be expressed. How does the sexist learn the error of their ways? Let me tell you I am a disagreeable person by nature... and if your approach to my Catholic views was hostile I would have gone to war with you. You would kick me off the sub, but you would fail. You would fail to convince me of your position, I would be politically against you an enemy. Whereas if you had, as the feminist reading group I was a part of at university a million years ago, had invited me to discuss and disagree then I would have converted to being a liberal.

Those women in that group put up with me, and my  mind was changed. Now you can legitimately say they should not have had to put up with my younger self. Yes I agree... the thing is in reality I existed as I did, the mindset I had (informed by dogmatic Catholicism) still exists. But it is one that can be changed. But only if you engage in the conversation and work past the sexism/homophobia to converse with the person.

Look perhaps this will get me kicked or down voted. But I find they only way too convince is to have the conversation you might not want to have. With the person you don't want to have it, where you're not going to be welcome. At the end of the say I am still up for debate, argument and a heated exchange I just do it on the side of pro-choice ect.

Shutting the discussion down will not end you in the place you want. I am already stuck in a situation wherein the only people willing to debate I don't consider myself aligned with at all.

What is Progress to the Victim?,"Many pundits and politicians argue that anti-racism protestors fail to appreciate the racial progress we have made in America. There is no doubt that this country has made advancements to ameliorate some of its racial atrocities. Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass, W.E.B Du Bois, Dr. King, Ida B. Wells, Malcolm X, Thurgood Marshall, and infinitely more African-Americans ensured, through sacrifice, that life for the next generation would be better than their own. And while I am eternally grateful for the efforts of these selfless heroes, I do not rejoice in the crumbs of progress that a hostile government begrudgingly ceded. In fact, I do not put much value into the idea of racial ‘progress’ to begin with. I am tired of hearing about progress. Too often, the myth of progress tempts us into toxic complacency.

Maybe I am ‘ungrateful’. But if a man first shoots me and then later steals my wallet, I will not praise his progress. I do not see the progress that many speak of. The income gap between black and white households is roughly the same today as it was in 1970. Seemingly every month there is another video of an unarmed black man having his future stolen from him by state violence. Black schools are still underfunded and understaffed, while the government has poured money into a racially targeted drug war… Admittedly, those inequities are not as insuperable as slavery or segregation. But what is progress to the victim? What did progress do for Tamir Rice? What did it do for Laquan MacDonald? Walter Scott? Freddie Gray? Trayvon Martin? Eric Garner? Alton Sterling? Philando Castille? Michael Brown? Sandra Bland? Keith Lamont? Or Kalief Browder? My guess is that the grieving families of these murdered humans care very little to praise this government’s “progress”. Their loved ones were slain by the same disease that enchained their ancestors - racism. The only thing that ‘progressed’ was the method of destroying their black bodies - not the result. How can I call that progress? I do not see the progress in fighting to keep the Confederate flag over a monument instead of a battlefield. I do not see the progress in being enchained by a warden rather than a plantation owner. I do not see the progress in trading in those white hoods for red MAGA hats.

Their loved ones were slain by the same disease that enchained their ancestors - racism. The only thing that ‘progressed’ was the method of destroying their black bodies - not the result. How can I call that progress? I do not see the progress in fighting to keep the Confederate flag over a monument instead of a battlefield. I do not see the progress in being enchained by a warden rather than a plantation owner. I do not see the progress in trading in those white hoods for red MAGA hats. We are either equal, or we are not. We are either free, or we are not. Anything in between is not ‘progress’; it is injustice.",2461,31,2429,7.8083230503910555,1

Why not have a citizenshiop question on the census?,"hey.  I'm what the altright would call a ""cuckservative"".  I'm right of center, lean libertarian, but am convincable.

IDK the current status of it, but for a while there was a debate about putting a citizenship question the census.  To my understanding, the liberal rationale against it is that a citizenship question would scare people away from answering.

but I recently had a moral thought.  Back in the era of the founding, the framers enshrined slavery in our constitution with the ""3/5 compromise"".  Slaves could not vote, but slave owners wanted to inflate the population of their states so they used the non-voting subjugated class as fodder to increase their voting power.

How is counting non-citizens different from that?  You are counting an at risk group of people in order to boost the voting power of the dominant class.  Does that not inherantly go against the idea of ""one man; one vote"" when you count the non-voters for the sake of congressional representation?  Is that not inherantly anti-liberal?  furthermore, this ""overcounting"" would primarily help ""blue"" states, (CA, NY, NJ have over 20% of their population foreign born"", and liberals complain about how red states overrepresent themselves.

I’ve finally defected from r/T_D,"So I’ll preface this by letting everyone know that over the last 5 years I have been undergoing a radical shift in my world views and political stances. Just for reference, I am now 24 years of age. 

I was born and raised in a southern rural community by a Jewish mother (now Christian), and a w.a.s.p father. Needless to say, my upbringing was very conservative. I had a pretty easy life, never really knew hardship or money problems. Fox News on constantly in the house, military grandfather, lots of closeted racism...you get the picture.

From 18-22 I voted republican in generals and primaries. I thought I was doing the right thing. At 22, I met my (now) wife. She is a black woman. Not usually an important detail in general, but due to my upbringing, and the town I’m from, it’s out of the ordinary and I definitely expected backlash. Some came, but none from my family, thankfully. They love her, and have changed a lot of their ways of thinking. 

Anyway, she and I are both relatively intelligent people, up and up on our current events, politics, etc. but we had completely opposite views. A lot of the issues I never took notice of such as inequality, racism, systemic oppression, wage gaps, inequity, what have you, i had never given much thought to, and or, considered relevant or significant. Her story of her upbringing in public housing and her struggles as a person of color in our area of the nation really struck me. She is on the deans list at her university, a solid professional woman. I was always under the assumption that those sort of complaints came from deadbeats, etc. I was so wrong. I know that.

Anyway, after a couple of years of being exposed to new schools of political thought, I began to challenge the conservative narrative whenever I could. I began to be a supporter of universal healthcare, lgbtq rights, end of the war on drugs, ending modern imperialism, combating climate change, free college, etc. When I would see hateful posts on r/t_d that I used to love and agree with, I would become sickened with the human capacity to hate and denigrate another. I started voicing my opinions. Much to the chagrin of all active users there. I was threatened, doxed, insulted. It blew my mind. These were the same people that not too long ago were kind to me. 

Idk where I’m going here. I’m rambling. I just wanted to come here and say that I’m here now. I understand my errors. I know what’s right. I have a wonderful woman to thank for that. Her patience and faith in the good in me have prevailed. I’m not an incel beta cuck for desiring a decent existence for my fellow man like the people on r/t_d would have me believe. It requires a great deal of strength to shoulder truly caring about everyone you meet. Caring that they make enough money to survive, that they’re properly educated, that they have upward mobility.. Calloused Indifference (like the kind exhibited on r/t_d) requires no courage, strength, or utility. 

I’ve defected, and I’m so damned happy I made it out clean on the other side. They hate those of us who would work to do good for each other. I’ve seen who these people are first hand. I was one of them. We have to match their strength and aggression. We can’t get by on peace and love any more. We have to take the fight to them.

How really much are Republicans right wing... I'm A Czech.,"Here in Czech Republic, in our parliament, we have 8 major parties with 281 seats. I want you to introduce you to the one that's the furthest right, because it's still considerably too much left wing for Republicans. The party is called SPD or ""Strana Přímé Demokracie"" or in english The Party of Direct Democracy"".

Its program mirrors some parts Republican program. It is very much against accepting illegal immigrants and Islam, against giving welfare to lazy moochers, affirmative action, still increasing taxes for the rich and loosening bureaucracy to support businessmen as well as starting businessmen, they want liberation from international organization (in this case EU), strict law and order, are sceptic about gay rights and are against taking gun rights (Although in Czechia gun rights are already very controlled and in order to own one, you need to get a license, like for a car). Sounds familiar?

With such program, they're considered as basically far right extremist party, even though you Americas must be used to it. Now here are some points, which significantly differ them from republicans:

They favor actual fiscal responsibility and balanced budget, want to influence government programs such as education and Healthcare and IMPROVE it by better funding (unlike Republicans whose only answer to faulty government program is to defund it, make it private and turn it into shit), support useful college fields, raise wages to teachers as well as doctors and policemen. They support welfare programs for those, who actually need it, better conditions and improvement of rights for workers, make corrupt politicians and rich people responsible for their misdeeds, they don't reason their views on religious zealousy, so they aren't ""pro-life"" (as far as I know. Although if they are against abortions, they at least support welfare handouts for those who need, including (and especially) young parents), don't support abstinence-only sex education and creationism in schools and I doubt that their opposition to gay rights is based on faith, they're against property being obtained illegally (which would be penalized with 100% tax), which is unlike Republicans who don't care how you obtain anything, and they want to reform political system as a direct democracy, hence the name.

Not that I really trust them, because probably each of our parties are against corruption, yet Czechia is one of the most corrupt countries in Europe, so they're probably not any different. But I wanted to share interesting fact.

With that out of the way, I want to say that while Bernie is just about my last choice in 2020, I will lead a Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade to the polls on Election Day if Bernie is the nominee. No matter who the nominee is, whether it's Bernie, Biden, Harris, Gillibrand, or WHOEVER, they're going to be infinitely better than Trump.

No matter who the nominee is, we can be proud of them, and have faith they'll act in a dignified, graceful, moral way. We won't have to worry about them governing by fiat, or tweet. We won't have to worry about which piece of the government will be auctioned off to middle eastern royal families next.   


We can be proud again of this country and what it stands for, and begin to undo the damage of these 4 dark, lost years, and begin the process of rebuilding. We can do this no matter who the nominee is.

Let's talk Liberal Talkers,"  
If you're not a follower of liberal talk radio, you may not realize that the field of talkers has diminished quite a bit. I'm not an expert, so I may be out of the loop with different markets and not be fully aware of all talkers, but I've been listening to a couple of the nationally syndicated talkers for 10 years and some change.

At this point, it's a small field on terrestrial radio: **Stephanie Miller** and **Thom Hartmann**. Most recently, **Norman Goldman** ceased operation in mid-February. He used to be on in the evenings, EST. **Bill Press** appears to only run on WCPT in Chicago. But it's a different game on other formats.

I'm not an expert in radio, nor do I work in the business, but I've always been a radio-phile, myself, and since this is a format that seems to be struggling and dwindling (much like other radio formats), I'm curious to know if it's a national trend or just some markets.

I'm thinking listening *age* and *style* are two major factors;  


**Age**

Since most talk radio is on AM...talk radio skews to an older demographic, so if a 20-35 year old was going to listen, they're not likely to go to AM radio because ""my dad and grand-dad listened to **that**"". They'd prefer to stream it or go the podcast route.

&amp;#x200B;

**Style**

I just don't hear the delivery of liberal talk to be the same as conservative talk. Where I live, the local talkers go with a simple format: ""Liberals bad. Liberals trying to destroy us. They're at it at again!"" And if there's any headlines that liberals or conservatives could find a way to agree on (natural disasters, Westboro Baptist thugs, major tragedies), they spin it so they can continue to push the ""liberals bad"" narrative. Hate to say it, but it **sells**.   


And maybe that's why conservative talk is such a big winner...it's a *safe sell*. Plus, look at how few independent radio stations there are out there (By that I mean, less than a handful of stations owned by one company or an individual) compared to how many are owned by entities like iHeart and Cumulus, etc. It's amazing, but there are markets that have clearly done well with liberal talkers and have been flipped to something else despite that fact. A couple of years back, iHeart owned a station in LA that was Stephanie Miller's flagship station and they dropped her show for Limbaugh. Two years later, his ratings were still lower than hers prior to her show leaving. 

Again, I'm not in the radio biz, so I don't understand how it all works...but radio is in such a struggle, it seems. We've had a handful of stations flip several times since the mid-2000's. That was unheard of in the years before. Not that stations would flip, but flip at that rate. Crazy.  


Anyway, I'm curious to know if there are other regular listeners out there and for those of you who aren't listeners, why? Again, trying to get the convo going.

Looking for liberal opinion on justification for higher taxes-,"—TLDR at bottom—

To start off, our country (US) needs to see some tax reform. We need a lot more tax brackets, as a single person making $200 million a year is being taxed the same as a single person making over $500,001 a year. 

However, I do have an issue with taxes past 50%. I am currently in college, and will be graduating with double STEM majors a semester early. I’m not trying to flex about how smart I am, because it hasn’t been easy. I bust my ass every week to get good grades. My upcoming summer will consist of working and studying for my CFA in the winter (basically a finance CPA). Meanwhile, the vast majority of my peers are doing majors that are far easier and committing much less time to them. The people I went to high school with that didn’t go to college are not hard workers. 

I’m just curious how people justify high taxes (50%+) for people that have worked very hard to get to where they are. I’d like to understand the other side on this, and I think it’s important we have these conversations. 

Little bit of stats I’m going to provide; 

https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat36.pdf
A very small % of the workforce works 2 jobs. A tiny fraction is working 2 full time jobs. 

https://www.nber.org/digest/jul06/w11895.html
""Between 1979 and 2002, the frequency of long work hours increased by 14.4 percentage points among the top quintile of wage earners, but fell by 6.7 percentage points in the lowest quintile.""

TLDR: How do you reconcile taxing people that work hard to make more money at a much higher rate than most of the US populace? 

Also, I want to throw out there that I would not have a problem with up to 65/70% rate on income over ~$15 million. ",Liberal,throwaway1947262,0,1,2019-03-19,400,"Looking for liberal opinion on justification for higher taxes- —TLDR at bottom—

Little bit of stats I’m going to provide; 

https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat36.pdf
A very small % of the workforce works 2 jobs. A tiny fraction is working 2 full time jobs. 

https://www.nber.org/digest/jul06/w11895.html
""Between 1979 and 2002, the frequency of long work hours increased by 14.4 percentage points among the top quintile of wage earners, but fell by 6.7 percentage points in the lowest quintile.""

TLDR: How do you reconcile taxing people that work hard to make more money at a much higher rate than most of the US populace? 

Also, I want to throw out there that I would not have a problem with up to 65/70% rate on income over ~$15 million. ",1749,62,1686,7.466799475018602,1
What are some of the things you’ve heard republicans say in real life?,"Ok, so let me start. I live in the hart of a Trump country red state. There’s only me and this other guy that are not white/republican at work and those guys don’t hold back for shit.

A conversation I’ve heard: 
When the caravan thing was allover the news. Dipshit: “they say it’s not an invasion, yes it’s an invasion. If you see thousands of cockroaches down the street from your house and theses roaches made it clear that they’re aiming for you house as a destination, are you going to kill them before they get to your house or are you going to wait for when they’re crawling allover your house?” Then they proceeded to talk about whether or not they would get in trouble if they go to the boarder with a sniper rifle and start shooting “them” since they’re not on American soil. Thankfully, our state is far from the border, they were just fantasizing.

Another one: 
I was in a room with about 7 other coworkers. They were telling crazy stories and things people did at the job that got them fired. Someone said something along the lines of “it’s hard to get fired”. Then this Mormon guy goes: “unless you’re a white male”. Everyone in the room shook their head in agreement (THEY WERE ALL WHITE MALES!).

There’s more stupidity I’ve come across but these are the most ridiculous examples I can think of.

Throwaway account or maybe I’ll just keep it to keep updating with their stories.

The Case for Deplatforming,"  

Oftentimes the topic of free speech is spoken of in binary terms. Either you’re for it or against it. But is that really the nature of this debate or are we actually talking about several rights and moral principles that oftentimes find themselves in conflict with one another. I think a certain segment of so-called free speech advocates need to be brought to task about the hidden assumptions of their argument. Namely that free speech is the highest moral principle and that all others are secondary to it.

In July of 2016 former Breitbart tech Editor and internet troll Milo Yiannopolis was banned from Twitter for the third and final time as a consequence to his tweets about comedian and SNL actress Leslie Jones in regards to her role in the 2016 reimagining of Ghostbusters. 

The Ghostbusters film became the latest victim of the modern culture war due to its largely female cast as opposed to the original Ghostbusters movie which exclusively featured all-male leads. Milo was just one of several individuals involved in the harassment campaign against the actresses in the movie with Leslie Jones being especially singled out for ridicule due to the fact that she was not only female but also black. 

Several jokes posted by Milo referenced Leslie Jones race and included insinuations that she was or looked like a man. Furthermore, many of Milo’s followers made fake tweets that implied that Leslie Jones was anti-Semitic, homophobic and racist towards whites. Twits that Milo, whom I should point out is the editor of the technology section of a conservative online news organization, screen capped and shared with the rest of his 300,000+ followers without confirming or perhaps caring whether the twits were real.  

While expressing criticism of Milo as an insincere troll who approaches everything as a performance free speech advocate and fellow provocateur Sam Harris complained that twitter and the biased liberal media had been unfair to Milo given that twitter apparently doesn’t ban jihadists reliably enough for his taste.  Now one has to admire Harris’ ability to relate everything to Islamic extremism but one would think that if he had time to compare the matter to the completely unrelated topic of terrorism he would have at least found the time to mention the specifics surrounding Milo Yiannopolis’ banning rather than casually throwing around accusations of a conspiracy of liberal media bias based on flimsy evidence.

As self-serving as the narrative of liberal bias is to Sam Harris’ own career as an internet provocateur there’s another more plausible explanation for twitter’s actions. Profit motive. One of Leslie Jones own twits related to the incident with Milo demonstrates this quite well. “I use to wonder why some celebs don’t have Twitter accts. Now I know. You can’t be nice and communicate with fans cause people are crazy.” She went on to say in another tweet. “I leave Twitter tonight with tears and a very sad heart. All this cause I did a movie. You can the movie but the shit I got today…wrong.”

Contrary to Harris’ claim twitter is not driven by progressive politics. If anything Twitter and other social media sites are generally loathe to regulate content on their sites due in no small part to the costs it would incur. The harassment that Leslie Jones suffered however was a hit to their reputation. Celebrities drive millions of viewers to their site and as big of a following a few dozen internet trolls may have celebrities will undoubtedly drive more traffic. Simply put it’s not in Twitter’s financial interest to allow rampant harassment on their site. If they did such harassment would drive everyone but the trolls themselves off of it and Twitter would make far less money. Then a competitor with higher standards would come around and take the lead in their corner of the social media market. 

So the situation is not as black and white as some would have others believe. There are several moral principles at play here. There’s Milo’s right to free speech. There’s Leslie Jones right to be free of harassment and not be slandered. And there’s Twitters right to free association, regulate the use of their property and protect their reputation. In this particular case Twitter choose to protect its rights and perhaps incidentally Leslie Jones at Milo’s expense. It’s not a given that the principle of free speech should take precedent over all other concerns and given the fate of Milo’s career Twitters decision indisputably worked out for the best.

In 2018 Milo Yiannapolis would be invited to the Conservative Political Action Committee or CPAC. CPAC is an annual conservative conference notorious for its controversial speakers. One frequent speaker Ann Coulter suggested once that women be deprived of the right to vote because they vote Democrat too often. Other speakers have included Michelle Malkin who wrote a book defending the internment of Japanese Americans during WWII and former Republican Senator Rick Santorum who criticized the Lawrence v Texas decision of the Supreme Court. You know the decision that made it illegal to literally incarcerate people for having gay sex.

But apparently Milo was too controversial for even CPAC because many of its sponsors expressed dissatisfaction with CPAC Organizer Matt Schlapp’s decision to invite Milo to CPAC 2017 without consulting them. Or perhaps the real problem was the fact that Milo is gay. In any case nothing could be done about it now. If CPAC banned Milo they’d have to contend with his thousands of loyal fans who were more than willing to start a harassment campaign of spreading lies and spouting racially charged obscenities at CPAC affiliated institutions if they dared revoke the invitation. You know because free speech. Highest moral priority and all. 

But leading up to the event videos resurfaced of Milo defending sexual relationships between adult men and teenage boys. Finally, CPAC sponsors got the excuse they needed and Matt Schlapp was given no choice but to rescind his invitation to let Milo speak at CPAC. These events were quickly followed by Milo being fired from Breitbart, losing his book deal and basically all other means of making easy money by being a troll. Finally, Milo said something irredeemably stupid, which was encourage the exploitation of minors for sexual gratification. But is that really how low the bar should be set to expunge someone from the public debate?  

I’ve already articulated that free speech isn’t the only moral principle out there and how advocates of free speech tend to ignore them but that’s not the only problem here. I think the manner in which some free speech advocates talk about this issue actually works to undermine free speech as a moral principle. In the past five or so years the topic of free speech almost always comes up in the context of accusations of some form of expressed bigotry. Many of these accusations are illegitimate but let’s be honest, most of them are not. 

In December of 2018 Carl Benjamin, better known as Sargon of Akkad, a prominent youtuber known for his involvement in the Gamergate Scandal was banned from Patreon citing their hate speech guidelines. Patreon doesn’t produce content per say but instead functions as a means for content creators to receive money i.e. patronage from their supporters. In an interview on another creator’s youtube channel Sargon said the following:

*“I just can’t be bothered with people who chose to treat me like this. It’s really annoying. Like, I* *—* *. You’re acting like a bunch of n\*\*\*\*\*s, just so you know. You act like white n\*\*\*\*\*s. Exactly how you describe black people acting is the impression I get dealing with the Alt Right. I’m really, I’m just not in the mood to deal with this kind of disrespect.”*

*“Look, you carry on, but don’t expect me to then have a debate with one of your f\*\*gots.…Like why would I bother?…Maybe you’re just acting like a n\*\*\*\*r, mate? Have you considered that? Do you think white people act like this? White people are meant to be polite and respectful to one another, and you guys can’t even act like white people, it’s really amazing to me.*

[https://patreonhq.com/hate-speech-on-patreon-a9026e52c2cf](https://patreonhq.com/hate-speech-on-patreon-a9026e52c2cf)

Sargon’s fellow provocateurs including Sam Harris, Jordan Peterson and Dave Rubin took umbrage with Patreon’s clearly amoral decision to no longer facilitate financial support to someone who violated their guidelines and decided to call for a boycott of Patreon. But they’re not hurting Patreon who would only end up losing the very people they don’t want on their platform anyway. In fact, I would argue their hurting free speech.

There’s a political concept called framing that refers to the way ideas are conveyed such that they come across as appealing or unappealing as possible to further a particular narrative. Free speech advocates are very good at framing the free speech debate in binary terms. It’s easy to win the debate when framed as a battle between those who favor free speech and those who don’t but as I suggested at the beginning of this podcast that’s not the real discussion. In recent years free speech is almost always brought up within the context of hate speech and while a binary framing may help you win the battle the hate speech framing won’t help win the war.

Hate speech has victims like Leslie Jones and those victims along with their supporters are being presented with a choice by Sam Harris, Jordan Peterson and Dave Rubin. A false choice that you can only be for free speech if you tolerate the proliferation of hate speech. 

During the Civil Rights Era, Rosa Parks was selected to be the face of the Montgomery boycott. This wasn’t an arbitrary decision. She wasn’t the first person to refuse to give up her seat to a white man but she was the ideal representative for the cause. Rosa Parks allowed Civil Rights activists to control the debate and frame their cause as one where hardworking, honest African Americans were unjustly being subjected to discrimination by Montgomery’s public transportation system. The Rosa Parks of the Free Speech movement however are mostly unapologetic hatemongers like Milo Yianaopolis, Sargon of Akkad and Ann Coulter. Not exactly compelling mascots for a cause.

It’s important to understand that free speech, barring government intervention is simply a moral principle not a legal requirement. It’s enforcement hinges on the perceived mutual interest of everyone within society to uphold it. When free speech becomes so strongly associated as a rhetorical, partisan shorthand to protect bigots from the repercussions of what they say it becomes nothing more than a euphemism like state’s rights or religious freedom. It stops meaning what it is supposed to mean and just becomes an excuse to be an asshole. 

And what does anyone actually gain from this bargain? Does giving Milo getting another book deal in any meaningful way advance the discussion of… well anything? Did his harassment campaigns against several women really contribute to the discussion of gender relations or minority representation in media? What exactly was Ann Coulter’s contribution to American society when her anti-immigrant ramblings pressured the President of the United States to go back on a deal and shutdown the government for the longest period in American history leaving thousands of Americans without a pay check. What is the actual material benefit of hate speech?

Now I would point out that there are legitimate concerns here. People are falsely accused of hate speech and de-platformed as a result. A robust attempt to weed out any provocative discussion by institutions and social media platforms can overreach. But criticizing every crackdown regardless of the reason doesn’t help. The “marketplace of ideas” if you want to generously call public discourse that like any market requires regulation to work effectively.  Not every participant in the market is selling a product worth selling and without oversight the rampant distribution of bad ideas can cause people to lose faith in the market. 

Furthermore, public discourse has limited bandwidth and if it’s crowded out by trolls and bigots then every discussion becomes about the very thing said trolls and bigots say they hate, identity politics. As long as we’re debating whether or not Mexicans are murderers and rapists we’re not debating the actual merits of immigration policy.

Rights are not absolute moral proclamations. Not unless you’re an anarchist or libertarian, two of the most simplistic and politically unsuccessful moral ideologies known to man. Rights are ideas that have to be carefully considered within the relevant context and more often than not work against one another. The answers as to how we weight and consider rights in relation to one another are not easy or obvious and sometimes certain rights will have to supersede others. All because someone doesn’t think a given right is the most important in one context doesn’t mean they’ll feel the same in other. And you’ll be hard pressed to find someone who thinks a given right should supersede another in all contexts. Even if they claim they do for profit related motives.",Liberal,rodog22,0,1,2019-03-28,391,"The Case for Deplatforming   

Oftentimes the topic of free speech is spoken of in binary terms. Either you’re for it or against it. But is that really the nature of this debate or are we actually talking about several rights and moral principles that oftentimes find themselves in conflict with one another. I think a certain segment of so-called free speech advocates need to be brought to task about the hidden assumptions of their argument. Namely that free speech is the highest moral principle and that all others are secondary to it.

&gt;Gilbert: So how late in the third trimester would you be able to do that?

&gt;Tran: It’s very unfortunate that our physician witnesses were not able to attend today.

&gt;Gilbert: No, I’m talking about your bill. How late in the third trimester could a physician perform an abortion if he indicated it would impair the mental health of the woman?

&gt;Tran: Or physical health.

&gt;Gilbert: Okay. I’m talking about the mental health.
Tran: Through the third trimester. The third trimester goes all the way up to 40 weeks.

&gt;Gilbert: Okay. But to the end of the third trimester?

&gt;Tran: Yep. I don’t think we have a limit in the bill.

&gt;Gilbert: Where it’s obvious a woman is about to give birth, that she has physical signs that she is about to give birth. Would that be a point at which she could still request an abortion if she was so certified? She’s dilating.

&gt;Tran: Mr. Chairman, that would be a decision that the doctor, the physician, and the woman would make at that point.

&gt;Gilbert: I understand that. I’m asking if your bill allows that.

Tran: Through the third trimester. The third trimester goes all the way up to 40 weeks.

&gt;Gilbert: Okay. But to the end of the third trimester?

&gt;Tran: Yep. I don’t think we have a limit in the bill.

&gt;Gilbert: Where it’s obvious a woman is about to give birth, that she has physical signs that she is about to give birth. Would that be a point at which she could still request an abortion if she was so certified? She’s dilating.

&gt;Tran: Mr. Chairman, that would be a decision that the doctor, the physician, and the woman would make at that point.

&gt;Gilbert: I understand that. I’m asking if your bill allows that.

&gt;Tran: My bill would allow that, yes.


Am I correct in assuming that this is radical? Most pro-choice people I've interacted with don't seem to believe in this type of abortion",1790,95,1694,7.489970898834801,1

Friendly conservative here with a question for you on abortion...,"Please keep it respectful -

I know that not all liberals believe the same things as other liberals and that not all conservatives believe the same things as other conservatives, so I’m not trying to categorize anyone by way of their political beliefs or otherwise when I ask this.

In regards to this abortion hype with the extended abortion term period... I can objectively see why this law is in place. I may not agree with it, but I can see how the law would help someone that wants to get an abortion and not have to jump through as many hoops as there are currently. Fair.

This may be a dumb question, but would any of you actually abort a baby super late into the pregnancy term when it’s CLEARLY a formed being with a beating heart etc.. like.. 15 days to a month before the due date? What about a few seconds before?

This is not meant to offend anyone; I know you’re not a bunch of savages. I’m just trying to understand the minds of those I have disagreements with.

"Counter points about hating ""Government""","A government is  the governing body of a nation, state, or community. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's that simple. It doesn't matter where you go, the moment more than one person is working together there is some kind of government at play.   


Today on Ask Trump Supporters, a question was posed asking when does the government best the private sector. Incredibly, the most common response is the Military. That command economy merit based society with high training, welfare, hands on management, held accountable, regulated faction of the United States that commands floating cities with more airpower than most nations in the world, and global reach.    


Ask for examples.  
When talking to anyone trying to sell you that the private, plutocratic, invisible hand mentality is the best way to go, ask for examples in real life and history. Because at no time in history did a plutocratic/ corporate society held out for long before the economy stagnated and corruption rotted that system of government to the ground. 

&amp;#x200B;

The best reasons to have an organized governing structure is accountability, anti-corruption, data tiered data analysis of the people and resources, and bulk purchases of goods and services to supply to the public and prepare for disasters and issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Explain basic civics.**   
There are generally two axis to most government types. Power and authority on one, wealth and economy on the other. 

&amp;#x200B;

With power and authority, three of the most basic examples are easily explained as starting points. A single ruler (Monarch, Dictator), a layered rule (Republic, leader based), and a rule by the people (Democracy). Each with advantages and disadvantages.  


[https://trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/teacher\_lessons/3branches/1.htm](https://trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/teacher_lessons/3branches/1.htm)

&amp;#x200B;

**A King.**

A single ruler is quick and easy. Fast and effective. However is quicker to corrupt and pursuaid into making bad decisions, especially when they believe they are the best of the best because of the seat of power they hold. In the States, we have the president who is elected mostly by the general population to fill this role, and can act as a dictator in times of emergencies and crisis. Because an imperfect action is often better than no action at all.

&amp;#x200B;

**Representatives**

A layered rule such as a Republic or some kind of body of leaders offers better information and management of specialized tasks and responsibilities. It requires more effort to corrupt and distort as hopefully merit based and elected officials will have a shared say, and have to discuss with peers for actions. It also means they are held accountable by their peers if embezzlement or criminal activity is pursued or carried out. In the states we have Congress and the Senet. Elected into office by groups of people to represent them. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Rule by all**

A total democracy is a full rule by the people, it's slow and a fools vote is equal to a scholar. Democracy is determined by how accountable the government is to the people, and whether or not the government reflect the populations best interest, or is corrupt and serving other powers such as a foreign body or corruption. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Wealth &amp; Economy**  
This is where Conservatives will tell you the government fails at most. Spending other people's money is the worst way to go about things and should be avoided at all cost and try to sell you that private business is the best way to go. I have no examples of when privatization was better than an uncorrupted government once funding was factored in. Every project in history performed best when it was given resources, proper management, and was held accountable. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Economic Anarchy**  
Free Market and the invisible hand. Where the wealth is, incentives follow. No regulations or management is taken into account and theft against the poor and powerless via slavery is quick to take effect. Workers can't defend themselves against an organized power with money and marshal forces so they are limited to basic work. Micro empires rise as corporations, but in every instance, the most organized, regulated groups of people take over and the Freemarket disappears. It is the line when the greed get too greedy, paranoid, and are overthrown. The fall of Capitalism is when consumers are bankrupt and the wealthy blame them for it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Command Economies, Socialism &amp; Communism.**

The very moment control is taken to manage resources is when a command economy takes shape. Socialism is where the governing body takes control of some or all services to enable the public to perform well, by mass managing, bulk buying and problem prevention through trends and analysis goods and services such as roads, military, disaster response, emergency response, medical, financial safety nets, disability management, and so on. The last elements to be taken over and the push into Communism occurs when luxury services and economic caps are put in place to regulate the wealthy and prevent them from becoming too powerful to manage, and leave ruin the state. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Examples**

We have many examples in history regarding the private sector taking over, and the moment a business opens shares to the public, workers comp and investments drop. The moment pro-profit healthcare was allowed under Reagan, we saw healthcare costs increase. When we look at public and private schools, the biggest factor is money. Public schools that are well funded and regulated perform just as well as private schools.   


In the United States, we have cities that specialize and perform better due to the focused mindset than if they were attempting to be jack of all trades social centers. Unless you seriously think everyone should design and build their own car from scratch, it's a very good idea that we have predictable settings such as roads that are maintained for specialized vehicles to operate on, designed by people who specialize in vehicular design. They couldn't design those cars if they were too busy farming and training in a militia. 

&amp;#x200B;

So when you try to tell me that Government is stupid, or some other nonsense, I'm going to need you to clarify. Because as far as I'm concerned, corruption is the problem, and Conservatives don't hate organizations, they hate being held accountable and having regulations keep them in check from making money off the suffering of others.  


As usual, I'm going to post something I picked up somewhere. Two links that show how Conservatives are the problem in America, and I have yet to see anything that counter discusses this.

Kick ass today, the world needs you to.

&amp;#x200B;",Liberal,Zelk,0,0,2019-02-11,436,"Counter points about hating ""Government"" A government is  the governing body of a nation, state, or community. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's that simple. It doesn't matter where you go, the moment more than one person is working together there is some kind of government at play.   


Today on Ask Trump Supporters, a question was posed asking when does the government best the private sector. Incredibly, the most common response is the Military. That command economy merit based society with high training, welfare, hands on management, held accountable, regulated faction of the United States that commands floating cities with more airpower than most nations in the world, and global reach.    


Ask for examples.  
When talking to anyone trying to sell you that the private, plutocratic, invisible hand mentality is the best way to go, ask for examples in real life and history. Because at no time in history did a plutocratic/ corporate society held out for long before the economy stagnated and corruption rotted that system of government to the ground. 

&amp;#x200B;

The best reasons to have an organized governing structure is accountability, anti-corruption, data tiered data analysis of the people and resources, and bulk purchases of goods and services to supply to the public and prepare for disasters and issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Explain basic civics.**   
There are generally two axis to most government types. Power and authority on one, wealth and economy on the other. 

&amp;#x200B;

With power and authority, three of the most basic examples are easily explained as starting points. A single ruler (Monarch, Dictator), a layered rule (Republic, leader based), and a rule by the people (Democracy). Each with advantages and disadvantages.  


[https://trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/teacher\_lessons/3branches/1.htm](https://trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/teacher_lessons/3branches/1.htm)

&amp;#x200B;

**A King.**

A single ruler is quick and easy. Fast and effective. However is quicker to corrupt and pursuaid into making bad decisions, especially when they believe they are the best of the best because of the seat of power they hold. In the States, we have the president who is elected mostly by the general population to fill this role, and can act as a dictator in times of emergencies and crisis. Because an imperfect action is often better than no action at all.

&amp;#x200B;

**Representatives**

A layered rule such as a Republic or some kind of body of leaders offers better information and management of specialized tasks and responsibilities. It requires more effort to corrupt and distort as hopefully merit based and elected officials will have a shared say, and have to discuss with peers for actions. It also means they are held accountable by their peers if embezzlement or criminal activity is pursued or carried out. In the states we have Congress and the Senet. Elected into office by groups of people to represent them. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Rule by all**

A total democracy is a full rule by the people, it's slow and a fools vote is equal to a scholar. Democracy is determined by how accountable the government is to the people, and whether or not the government reflect the populations best interest, or is corrupt and serving other powers such as a foreign body or corruption. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Wealth &amp; Economy**  
This is where Conservatives will tell you the government fails at most. Spending other people's money is the worst way to go about things and should be avoided at all cost and try to sell you that private business is the best way to go. I have no examples of when privatization was better than an uncorrupted government once funding was factored in. Every project in history performed best when it was given resources, proper management, and was held accountable. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Economic Anarchy**  
Free Market and the invisible hand. Where the wealth is, incentives follow. No regulations or management is taken into account and theft against the poor and powerless via slavery is quick to take effect. Workers can't defend themselves against an organized power with money and marshal forces so they are limited to basic work. Micro empires rise as corporations, but in every instance, the most organized, regulated groups of people take over and the Freemarket disappears. It is the line when the greed get too greedy, paranoid, and are overthrown. The fall of Capitalism is when consumers are bankrupt and the wealthy blame them for it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Command Economies, Socialism &amp; Communism.**

The very moment control is taken to manage resources is when a command economy takes shape. Socialism is where the governing body takes control of some or all services to enable the public to perform well, by mass managing, bulk buying and problem prevention through trends and analysis goods and services such as roads, military, disaster response, emergency response, medical, financial safety nets, disability management, and so on. The last elements to be taken over and the push into Communism occurs when luxury services and economic caps are put in place to regulate the wealthy and prevent them from becoming too powerful to manage, and leave ruin the state. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Examples**

We have many examples in history regarding the private sector taking over, and the moment a business opens shares to the public, workers comp and investments drop. The moment pro-profit healthcare was allowed under Reagan, we saw healthcare costs increase. When we look at public and private schools, the biggest factor is money. Public schools that are well funded and regulated perform just as well as private schools.   


In the United States, we have cities that specialize and perform better due to the focused mindset than if they were attempting to be jack of all trades social centers. Unless you seriously think everyone should design and build their own car from scratch, it's a very good idea that we have predictable settings such as roads that are maintained for specialized vehicles to operate on, designed by people who specialize in vehicular design. They couldn't design those cars if they were too busy farming and training in a militia. 

&amp;#x200B;

My frustrated email to the Department of Revenue,"""Hello,

I   am submitting documents to help prove that the levy placed onto my   account is my income and separate from any income of my mothers, \*\*\*\*\*\*  \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*. Other than signing a piece of paper allowing me to open these   accounts as a minor in 2009 my mother is not linked to my checking and   savings account.

Currently, I am  attending graduate school at University of Wisconsin- Madison. My  only  source of income is from an Advance Opportunity Fellow for first   generation college students of underrepresented minorities and  non-minority disadvantaged graduate students beginning October 1st.   Direct deposits from the University occurs on the 1st of each month. I  have the stubs from the last 4 months attached.

I   hope this can be resolved quickly. I have no other sources of income   and have no other money to pay for food, gas, or bills than what is  being levied from my accounts.

In   addition to myself, I hope the Department of Revenue would consider   flexibility with my mother until she sells her restaurant and can pay   her back-taxes. We are a low income, minority, single parent family that   has struggled to survive, not the top 1%. A levy placed on money that   can be used to pay for food or make a house payment is a direct route  to  homelessness. Homelessness of one person costs the state and  taxpayers  substantially more money (approximately $35,000 per year)  than someone  who is behind on house taxes of a home valued at less than  $135,000. The  snowball effect of late fees and interest in one year  has turned $3,000 into $9,000 owed and is an exploitation of someone who  is trying to do what she can to  keep her small business open for the  time being and a roof over our  heads. She is not hiding money, she has  no money. Patience is all we can ask for.

TLDR: oh my.  


\--------  
The camps at the border where we're putting people seeking asylum aren't even up to the standards of prisons, and many of the people in those camps have committed no crimes; they literally walked up to the wall, and said to the border patrol that they'd like to request asylum, as if they go back home, they're gonna die.

That bit is really really important; many of these people have broken no laws, and are following the exact procedure our government required of them. With the context of ""a good number of these people have done nothing wrong ""...

Rounding it out, this one's easy. Let's look up the definition of ""concentration camp"".[https://www.google.com/search?q=concentration+camp](https://www.google.com/search?q=concentration+camp)*a place where large numbers of people, especially political prisoners or members of persecuted minorities, are deliberately imprisoned in a relatively small area with inadequate facilities, sometimes to provide forced labor or to await mass execution.*

So, the asylum seekers are making the claim that they're fleeing death, and we have good reason to believe that's true in some cases. They're seeking asylum because of persecution. We have them in cages, and the medical care we do provide winds up with a lotta people dead. We've accidentally sold kids into slavery, split kids from their parents, taken no responsibility when our contracting staff rapes the kids, and have no way of getting many of those children back to their parents... which is \*also\* technically human trafficking if we look at international law.

They're not doing labor \*or\* awaiting execution, but those are actually optional in the definition of a concentration camp. **I wish it wasn't the case, but yeah, by the quick definition, the US seems to be running concentration camps on the southern border.**

Someone else responded that that was bullshit, and honestly, that seemed the more reasonable side.

So I went digging for an hour, and here goes.

TLDR: oh my.  


\--------  
The camps at the border where we're putting people seeking asylum aren't even up to the standards of prisons, and many of the people in those camps have committed no crimes; they literally walked up to the wall, and said to the border patrol that they'd like to request asylum, as if they go back home, they're gonna die.

That bit is really really important; many of these people have broken no laws, and are following the exact procedure our government required of them. With the context of ""a good number of these people have done nothing wrong ""...

The organization running the camps has said it holds no responsibility for their staff literally raping children:[https://www.aclu.org/blog/immigrants-rights/immigrants-rights-and-detention/ice-detention-center-says-its-not-responsible](https://www.aclu.org/blog/immigrants-rights/immigrants-rights-and-detention/ice-detention-center-says-its-not-responsible)

People also, you know, die in those camps, and it's more lately:[https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/22-immigrants-died-ice-detention-centers-during-past-2-years-n954781](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/22-immigrants-died-ice-detention-centers-during-past-2-years-n954781)

I saw some videos debunking him such as by polidice, which are interesting.
There are other issues I don't know he's correct about and should be taken seriously, but I hadn't look them up yet. Anyway, what is your take on his positions and how credible is he?

A theory on Trump &amp; the shut down,"Ok, this is all guess work, I'm hoping some fellow liberals can help me flesh out this possible conspiracy theory.  

If we assume that Trump is working for Putin, which seems obvious to me after he announced removing US troops from Syria.

Add the fact that Trump said he'd let the Shutdown go for a year plus.

I think Putin ordered Trump to shut down the government, and leave it shut down until all the federal workers quit since they need money to live.  He even announced after the shutdown begin that he was cancelling all federal pay raises.  

Imagine the chaos that would proceed if there was NO USA government.  It could even be a prelude to an actual Russian attack.

Dear Senator Schumer,

Just 8 days ago, you were proud to vote for spending zero dollars on the wall. Today, I read in the papers that you've agreed to a whopping 1.6 billion dollars for the wall you called ineffective just 8 days ago. This is not opposition to anything. This is complete capitulation. Trump couldn't have hoped for a better friend in the Democratic Party than you at the moment.

What gives?

Can we rely on you to be a progressive and a liberal? Or, are you just giving us more of the business as usual that we've come to expect from conservative Democrats for the last nearly four decades?

This is extremely disappointing.

I promise to remember this complete betrayal of progressive and liberal values when you are next up for reelection.

Today, I read in the papers that you've agreed to a whopping 1.6 billion dollars for the wall you called ineffective just 8 days ago. This is not opposition to anything. This is complete capitulation. Trump couldn't have hoped for a better friend in the Democratic Party than you at the moment.

What gives?

Can we rely on you to be a progressive and a liberal? Or, are you just giving us more of the business as usual that we've come to expect from conservative Democrats for the last nearly four decades?

This is extremely disappointing.

I promise to remember this complete betrayal of progressive and liberal values when you are next up for reelection.

Sincerely,",1321,41,1279,7.186144304522325,1

Immigrants can be racist too,"Hey guys. I had a complaint about liberal philosophy. I am specifically speaking to the those people who are Democrats or Liberals, support candidates like Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Barrack Obama, Justin Trudeau. 

In liberal philosophy, there is a huge outrage against white supremacists, white racists, conservative racists. However, I never hear you guys, or any news station, speaking about racist immigrants.

I believe that immigrants can be racist too, and some are. Of course not all of them, but some of them. When they come to America, they come thinking “I love my race, and I hate middle eastern”  or they dislike Black people, or they dislike white people, etc etc.

This is common. I want to ask if you guys can start putting a spotlight on that as well. If we are seeking justice, we must seek it equally with everyone, not just blame everything on where people.

What does it take to get through to Trump supporters?,"I genuinely don’t know if they’re too dumb to realize he’s a complete dumpster fire of a president or they’re too prideful to admit it. And this isn’t about his (idiotic) policies, this is about him being so blatantly unfit for the position with absolutely no capacity or willingness to learn the job.

I can’t believe these people are okay with having an unhinged middle school bully running the country, let alone *worshiping* one like they do. 

Honestly, what do you think it would take for them to at least step back for a second and say, “Hmm, maybe this orange buffoon isn’t the God-send we thought he was”? 

It’s clear that you can’t reason with these people. They just go with whatever their gut tells them and won’t back down no matter how much evidence to the contrary. Just like their dear leader. So things like reports of corruption in the administration don’t seem to be a promising route to any intellectual paradigm shifts. Trump could be put behind bars and they’ll still claim it’s all a deep state conspiracy run by Obama and Hillary.




But there has to be a breaking point. 

He’s mocked veterans. He’s sided with violent foreign powers over his own country. He doesn’t have a consistent belief about anything. He’s bragged about committing sexual assault. He hasn’t spoken a coherent sentence in 17 years. Foreign leaders view him as a complete joke. He doesn’t lead our country with any shred of honesty or dignity. And he’s just so fucking stupid.


I seriously wonder how much support he would lose if he shot someone on fifth avenue. 




What news story could break tomorrow that you genuinely think would make a sizable dent in a his support?

Keep in mind, we’re talking about people who are denser than the earth’s core. I’ve said “this *has* to be it” a hundred times, and I’ve been wrong a hundred times. What’s something that wouldn’t just be tossed onto the pile and forgotten about by next week? And I don’t mean something like doing the truffle shuffle and castrating himself on the White House front lawn.  But seeing how far down the rabbit hole we already are, clearly it has to be something pretty outlandish. 

Think about every different shit show that’s happened on practically a weekly basis and think about how unwavering his voters have been in their support. How much worse could he act and still maintain his base’s devout loyalty? I know there’s a line out there that can be crossed, but I’m really struggling to see where it’s drawn.

(CONNECTICUT) CRIMINAL JUSTICE-PRISON-POLICE-SOCIAL-WELFARE-SCHOOL REFORM,"**It comes down to really 2 things:**

**(1)The environment in the home (kids need a stable and disciplined home)**

**(2)Lack of college education.**

&amp;#x200B;

**HAVE IN MIND:**

**The government does not own anyone** and we must remember the goal is to mainly reform and then use to contribute to the economy.

&amp;#x200B;

**GOALS:**

To reform and **give the tools to fully integrate** to contribute and prevent recidivism and broken homes.

**(1)Automatic erasure of all misdemeanors after 1 year** after offense and 2 years after offense for most felonies.

The longer you wait to pardon, the more recidivism and victims of crime you create.

**(2)Eliminate parole, probation, half-way houses**, ankle bracelets and others that contribute to recidivism and cost the state way too much. Once they’ve paid their debt (prison), let them go.

**(3)Prison sentencing**:

* **No prison for all misdemeanors** (just an overnight jail stay). Instead, we use the same system that's used for child support to automatically **deduct a percentage from their work check for 2 years**.
* Felonies that require less than 5 years do that time but anything that requires 5-15 just do 5 years. 15 1/2 or more just do 15 years. **Sentences can not exceed 15 years**.
* The mission of **prison is to reform to then help integrate** to then have them contribute. It's an investment. The most serious offenders like serial killers, mass shooters, mass rapers, sex traffickers, etc, get life and there's no parole.
* Crimes of survival are given no more than 15 years.

**(4)Inside prison reform**:

* **If you're doing 5 years or more, you must get your GED (or easier CT version diploma that can be introduced) and a college or trade degree in order to be released**.
* Those who do not cooperate will simply be left in prison until they do.
* **One person per cell**. Never two.
* The whole prison system will revolve around rehabilitation for full integration and correction officer safety.

**(5)Police reform**:

* **Licenses for all police** that can have points taken off and can even be revoked which will not allow them to be hired by another town if fired by the first one. If you're not professional enough for one town, you're a hazard and a liability (lawsuit) for another.
* **Body cameras for all police officers**. Citizens can access bodycam footage pertaining to their case. This is already being done by NYPD.
* **Business cards for all police** to give to those they have cases with. This is already being done by NYPD.
* **End the 'blue line' of secrecy and lying for one another**. It does not work in the favor of the people who pay their salaries (citizens they swore to protect). It's criminal and promotes criminal behavior and mentalities inside police departments.
* **The top 2 killers of police are traffic stops and domestic cases**.
* **No police pullovers or looking up plates anymore** unless vehicle behavior or condition is a threat to public safety or there's an APB out for vehicle. Tickets can be sent to address if there's a small violation. No need to pull anyone over and risk your life.
* **In domestic cases, both (or all) parties should be arrested** if they insist on the other being arrested. Children will go with relatives. This will end the charades and notion that one can rebel against their partner, provoke a fight and violent response, and then one can call police as a weapon.
* **Police quotas in any form should result in license revocation**, fine, and prison time. Same goes for those officers who assault detained suspects.
* **Infiltrate every police department** and have multiple informants there to keep tabs on all of their activities. Compartmentalize by giving different paper lists to different people. Info can't be hacked since it's on paper and it would be impossible to expose the whole thing since no one has the whole list.
* **Eliminate police raids and only go for the big fish** or terror-related threats. Go after the leaks instead of attacking the water. Have feds dirty their hands and use up their funds.
* **Eliminate Trump administration laws that oppress minorities and that give police more leeway to shoot**. We can't turn neighborhoods into shooting ranges.
* **De-militarize and de-gang police** and keep tabs on the federal training they receive.
* **Eliminate civil forfeiture** completely. It promotes corruption.
* **Eliminate polygraph tests for police job entrance** which have proven to be unreliable (NYPD, the biggest police force in the US, doesn't use them). Background check, testimonies of character, psychological exam as well as mental health history check shall do. If polygraph tests really worked, we would have perfect police with perfect police conduct.
* **End racial discrimination of gun permits**. They're based on the Constitution, not by the decision of a police chief who bases it off race many times from what I'm told. Going to state police who run a criminal and mental health background check should be enough.
* Killing the black market should be on the agenda and **legalizing firearm ownership more (like we're doing for marijuana) will reduce the black market for firearms which are responsible for the majority of gun-related street homicides**. Preservation of one’s own life or life of a loved one transcends laws of men.

**(6)Home reform**:

* **Eliminate child support and alimony** which promote financial rewards for breaking up families and encourage single-parent homes who do not and cannot contribute to the economy like two-parent homes can. The damage it does to children is life-long.
* **Marriage licenses should be required in order to receive temporary public assistance**. It will discourage and limit welfare fraud and will encourage two-parent homes who normally don’t need public assistance as much as single-parent homes.
* **Prenups should be automatic by law**. This will encourage two-parent homes.
* **By law, every job available in CT should be on**[ **Indeed.com**](https://indeed.com/) **and all employers in CT must hire from there**. **$15-16 an hour minimum wage**. **Every employment agency works for the state to end unemployment quickly**. **State union for all who work to make it harder to get fired**. **Employers encouraged and rewarded for making mostly full-time positions**. **You’re paid for 40 hours even if you just do 32**. Annuities from NY Life promoted.
* **Eliminate all CT Works centers**. Public assistance is temporary anyways.
* **Respect religious exemptions** and just plain ole ""no"" from parents who do not want to vaccinate their children.
* **Flu shot can not be required for any job**. No one can force something inside your body.
* **Protect families from DCF quotas and legal power to separate them**. De-fund them. If CT is against the inhumanity of Trump separating families at the border, then we should be fired up even more about American families being separated by strangers who just want more funding and just put children in worse homes where they'll more than likely be molested or sold in sex trafficking. Citizens aren't property for the government to threaten you out of your children. All I see DCF doing is taking advantage of minorities inability to afford legal help and taking their children in order to get funding.

**(7)School reform**:

* Condense high school curriculum.
* **Have students start college or trade degrees in high school**.
* **Job placement before graduation**.
* Driving schools are part of all high schools (start in major cities).
* **Body sculpting/building training should be done 4 days a week** and mandatory in order to graduate.
* **Make it illegal to drop-out of school and not have a high school diploma and college** or trade degree. **Those without either normally turn to crime and welfare**.
* Since high schools are the biggest target for mass shooters and bomb plotters, **metal detectors and bag checks should be at every high school entrance** like they did for Danbury high school which eliminated weapon-related threats and violence.
* **Station 3-4 police officers in every school**. From Elementary to High school.
* **Vaccines are never required** since the other students are vaccinated.
* **Home schooling options are made simpler for parents** through online schooling which **save the state money** by having less students at school.",Liberal,Americanglock,0,1,2018-12-23,486,"(CONNECTICUT) CRIMINAL JUSTICE-PRISON-POLICE-SOCIAL-WELFARE-SCHOOL REFORM **It comes down to really 2 things:**

"Maybe ""Institutional racism"" is the wrong word for the right concept","I feel as if a lot of people, including myself, have been confused by the term ""institutional racism"" for a long time. I'm not black, but I'm not white. I'm Pakistani, for clarification. The term implies that racism is written into laws, among all else; at least I thought so. In reality, an example of institutional racism would be a proposition to build a factory being lobbied by rich white men in the city to be placed near a black community rather than a white community since there are already things like a jail next to that neighborhood, therefor causing the people in that community, primarily black, to have a higher risk of lung problems due to immediate pollution. None of that had to do with law directly, and more had to do with the actions of selfish individuals. (Also, I should add that I got this analogy directly from a top comment on another reddit thread regarding racism that I can't find necessarily) I truly believe that a lot of what holds back the idea of institutional racism is the name of the term itself. America is a HIGHLY individualistic society, so if racism isn't being written into the laws I get the feeling that ""Institutional racism"" doesn't really make sense around here.

&amp;#x200B;

At the core, you have to have people understand that affirmative action is not founded in injustice, but actually serves a greater role. If the median+average black income is lower than the median+average white income, then affirmative action is a long-term solution with short-term frictions. If black people are 13% of the population in a city, they should hopefully be 13% of businesses in that city as well. This applies for all forms of AA. Of course, if AA is implemented BADLY, like a poor Asian kid not getting into college while a suburban black kid does, then of course it deserves to get called out. But of course there should always be a re-iteration of its purpose whenever things like this happens, or conservatives will eat up progress by taking those on the fence regarding these issues. Liberals have to be just in order to keep their ideals strong and favorable in front of moderates. 

&amp;#x200B;

So what's this rank all amounting to? Basically, if some old lady judge who works at your local court and determines a black man needs to wait until a court date for a 25 over speeding ticket but a white man can pay and plead guilty beforehand, that's ""institutional racism"" but it's not institutional racism. That old lady judge could be replaced with a young, modern man with very minimalist profiling tendencies. The institution didn't change, but the individual did. This is the sort of thing conservatives use to de-legitimize the actual meaning of ""institutional racism"" and play enough semantics that moderates feel afraid to use the term. This snowballs into an argument against AA, which is already misunderstood because the big picture starts to matter less than individual stories.

  
A better term might be ""incomplete egalitarianism"" to describe the system as it is. If everyone had true equal opportunity, but a demographic had a lower average income than another, than even 100 generations from now that demographic would still have a lower average income. Incomplete egalitarianism acknowledges that the goal we're looking for is egalitarianism, but the road to it has to involve more opportunity given to those with inherently less opportunity (on average). Though please, I'm not that smart and I know that sounds dumb, so anyone with a better alternative is welcome. ",Liberal,Marisa_Nya,0,1,2018-12-27,482,"Maybe ""Institutional racism"" is the wrong word for the right concept I feel as if a lot of people, including myself, have been confused by the term ""institutional racism"" for a long time. I'm not black, but I'm not white. I'm Pakistani, for clarification. The term implies that racism is written into laws, among all else; at least I thought so. In reality, an example of institutional racism would be a proposition to build a factory being lobbied by rich white men in the city to be placed near a black community rather than a white community since there are already things like a jail next to that neighborhood, therefor causing the people in that community, primarily black, to have a higher risk of lung problems due to immediate pollution. None of that had to do with law directly, and more had to do with the actions of selfish individuals. (Also, I should add that I got this analogy directly from a top comment on another reddit thread regarding racism that I can't find necessarily) I truly believe that a lot of what holds back the idea of institutional racism is the name of the term itself. America is a HIGHLY individualistic society, so if racism isn't being written into the laws I get the feeling that ""Institutional racism"" doesn't really make sense around here.

&amp;#x200B;

At the core, you have to have people understand that affirmative action is not founded in injustice, but actually serves a greater role. If the median+average black income is lower than the median+average white income, then affirmative action is a long-term solution with short-term frictions. If black people are 13% of the population in a city, they should hopefully be 13% of businesses in that city as well. This applies for all forms of AA. Of course, if AA is implemented BADLY, like a poor Asian kid not getting into college while a suburban black kid does, then of course it deserves to get called out. But of course there should always be a re-iteration of its purpose whenever things like this happens, or conservatives will eat up progress by taking those on the fence regarding these issues. Liberals have to be just in order to keep their ideals strong and favorable in front of moderates. 

&amp;#x200B;

So what's this rank all amounting to? Basically, if some old lady judge who works at your local court and determines a black man needs to wait until a court date for a 25 over speeding ticket but a white man can pay and plead guilty beforehand, that's ""institutional racism"" but it's not institutional racism. That old lady judge could be replaced with a young, modern man with very minimalist profiling tendencies. The institution didn't change, but the individual did. This is the sort of thing conservatives use to de-legitimize the actual meaning of ""institutional racism"" and play enough semantics that moderates feel afraid to use the term. This snowballs into an argument against AA, which is already misunderstood because the big picture starts to matter less than individual stories.

Just a reminder that the U.S. could save over half a Trillion dollars PER YEAR by implementing 3 common sense legislation pieces the rest of the world already has," Going by the conservative estimates (from a Koch brothers funded study, that is), transferring to a single payer health care system would save on average [$200 Billion per year](https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/blahous-costs-medicare-mercatus-working-paper-v1_1.pdf). Medicare for all is something virtually every other developed nation has and has better outcomes than the U.S..

Furthermore, tax loopholes exploited by the wealthy with teams of lawyers result in the loss of around [$70 Billion per year](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/10/opinion/gabriel-zucman-paradise-papers-tax-evasion.html). Of course there will always be loopholes and even the most comprehensive legislation couldn't solve all of tax avoidance. So let's call it $50 Billion.

The final part of this trifecta is the fact the U.S. spends more on it's defense budget ($610 Billion) than the next 7 largest militaries in the world [combined](https://www.defensenews.com/industry/2018/05/02/us-remains-top-military-spender-sipri-reports/). If you were to cut our defense spending in half, that would free up over $300 Billion AND we'd still be spending $77 Billion more than the second largest military budget, that being China's. Also it's important to note that most of the worlds largest militaries are our allies so that's an even further incentive to reallocate our tax dollars to something other than the military.

Add up all those saving and you wind up with a cool $555 Billion, PER YEAR.

That amount of money is enough to fund a Trillion dollar infrastructure bill to rebuild America over 10 years, which also includes a comprehensive 5G network all over the states ($100 Billion). That's enough to create tuition free college in the U.S. ([$75 Billion](https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/07/28/487794394/hillary-s-free-tuition-promise-what-would-it-cost-how-would-it-work)), something else the rest of the developed world has. That's enough to fully restore NASA's budget to 1% of the federal budget (an additional [$30 Billion](https://www.thebalance.com/nasa-budget-current-funding-and-history-3306321)).

You add up all those ""pie in the sky"", ""ultra radical"" amounts and you still wind up with $200 Billion PER YEAR left over to spend. That could go very nicely into a tax cut to the middle and poor class, or fixing the Flint Michigan water crisis. Just for example.

That's enough to dive head first into complying with the Paris Climate Agreement and to combat climate change ([$150 Billion](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/06/02/fact-checking-trump-speech-paris-climate-agreement/102399674/) at the very high end even according to Trump...).

You add up all those ""pie in the sky"", ""ultra radical"" amounts and you still wind up with $200 Billion PER YEAR left over to spend. That could go very nicely into a tax cut to the middle and poor class, or fixing the Flint Michigan water crisis. Just for example.

Please help me understand Antisemitism,"I haven't posted here before, and I'm not sure if this is the type of content typically on this sub, but this seemed like an appropriate place to ask about this topic I'm trying to wrap my head around. If not, please let me know and/or redirect me :)

So I'm trying to understand why Jewish people are targeted so heavily. I've heard historical explanations that they have generally been a minority community in most nations and were feared because they didn't ""belong"" to any nation throughout most of history. There is also, of course, the stereotype that they typically are obsessed with money (I'm not sure how this came about). Regardless, I don't really see why this particular group seems to have drawn the ire of so many hate groups or why people's fears have manifested in this way. Is it just human nature causing them to target minority groups? It just doesn't make sense to me that these people develop paranoia specifically surrounding the idea that there is a jewish elite pulling the strings behind the curtains. I guess maybe this was simply a narrative that could never be disproved and that played to pre-existing fears, hence why fascists have clung to it from their origins; but why jews? Even logically, I don't see what justifies the amount of fear and paranoia and attention this group has garnered from the hateful.

Maybe it really is just entirely without reason or logic. Human nature is a strange thing.

The biggest evidence we Asian guys got the best girls can be directly seen on how they look like, the only reason they can be/look like that is because they inherit our Asian genetics when their mother, mother's mothers and so on chose to be inseminated by us Asians guys, of course their mother, mother's mother also not look much different from them when they are young. If our Asian girls chose to be inseminated by western males losers, african males, etc other males then they will not look like that but will like uncute, too masculine, look too old western girls and other non Asian girls. About eye-rolling banana explosion only occur when the girl gives the guy intense pleasure and that is affected by how attractive they are, the more attractive especially innocent the girl then the more powerful the banana will explode.

Anyway, the 1st fundriser will get mod status on r/awcmovement and 1 article slot on www.antiwesterncosplayers.blogspot.be , this is the only chance because the next mod have to be fundrisers who contribute 10.000 yen on the fundrising. The mod status are limited for :

- Can approve and remove post.

- Can make flair.

- Etc other than deleting the sub.

As for the article slot, it have to do with the anti western cosplayers movement's purpose and it will be there for until 3 days before the end of this year. The fundrising are now on secure link http://www.antiwesterncosplayers.blogspot.be/2018/02/anti-western-cosplayers-movement.html

Join the anti western cosplayers movement if you don't want :

1. Racist western cosplayers keep doing racism against us Asians. When racist western cosplayers cosplaying our Anime characters are the same as they imitate us Asians because we Asians make our Anime characters based on us Asians which Japanese also agreed with http://www.antiwesterncosplayers.blogspot.be/2018/09/japanese-spoken-up-against-racist.html , imitating other race is racism.

2. Racist western cosplayers keep ruining Anime including the Anime characters you love. When racist western cosplayers cosplaying Anime characters they only end up ruining the characters because they look nothing like Anime characters because they are not Asian while Anime characters are based on us Asians http://www.antiwesterncosplayers.blogspot.be/2015/10/you-westerners-are-not-cute-too_22.html , millions of Anime fans especially in Japan are hurt by racist western cosplayers.

3. More racist trash such as trump to emerge, the anti western cosplayers movement are actually teaching western youth about how bad racism is, at least they will become aware about to not doing racism.

The minimum is 500 yen, 100 yen is around 1 usd and only Asians can participate in the fundrising, if you are not Asian you can still participate by joining the circles https://plus.google.com/117850404800846575560 and add more likes.

I plan to change the sub status from restricted to public too when there is another mod. As for the 2nd, 3rd and so on fundrisers will only get approved submitter status.

Know that you must not join the fundrising because you want to be a mod on r/awcmovement or to have an article posted on the anti western cosplayers movement site but simply because you agree with the anti western cosplayers movement. The mod status and 1 article slot is just a bonus.

I worry that if the Republicans win, the white hate groups in my town or a lone Trumper will be more emboldened and do something awful at my daughter's school. If they lose, I worry they'll do the same out of anger.

Dear Mr. Michael Bennett,"  

Dear Mr. Michael Bennett, 

I am a student at Dsst Stapleton in Denver and I am trying to become a more informed and responsible individual in today’s society because I feel that it is important to be aware of the all the things going on in the state and the country. It has come to my understanding the potential of renewable energy economically and communally here in Colorado. After reading a report of the Colorado Senate Bill 07-901 on how to connect Colorado’s renewable resources to the markets and doing some research I have a few questions and inputs that I’m curious about.  

I understand that there are multiple benefits from this type of energy helping insulate consumers from strained gas prices while supporting jobs and stimulating economic development. Where my conjecture lies is in the primary focus that you have in terms of a certain type of renewable energy. With potential in solar, wind, hydro, biomass and more, is there an area that deserves or demands more attention in terms of funding and research? The consensus that I’m arriving at is simple but worthy of statement. I noticed that you mention on your website that the potential of solar energy and the bill that you introduced to make it possible for people to share energy and save money. While solar energy accounts for just under 5% of the state’s renewable energy production is there a link between that percentage and the significant challenge of variable energy production driven by diurnal solar cycles regardless of land disputes and other challenges? Well, with the discovery of Renewable Resource Generation Development Areas (GDAs) might I educationally infer that there is more potential in wind energy in Colorado in terms of funding and execution? So let me explain, it has come to my understanding that nearly 80% of the renewable energy in Colorado is coming from wind energy. According to the Senate bill report in Colorado there are 8 GDA’s that have the potential for the development of over 96GW which is “over eight times Colorado’s current peak electricity use” (Wind Resources). To be fair the report says that in solar that 1300 GW of energy could be produced but that with 2 GDAs being completely covered with equipment. However, it holds true that, “only a small fraction of the land area would ever be contemplated for central solar power (CSP) farms” (Solar Resources) only about 2% of the GDAs to be exact. 

It seems that our interest should be shifted towards the development of wind energy more for the previous reasons and also the growing interest in the development of more energy that we can use for export to markets in the Southwestern States the bill report lists, Arizona, Nevada, and Southern California. Not only would we be able to generate enough wind to power Colorado but also stimulate the economy in such a way that fits your goal wanting to “ believe that innovation will help solve the world’s toughest challenges, which is why you continue to fight for funding for Colorado’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), ARPA-E, and many other energy programs.” (Clean Energy). So I guess in conclusion I ask, where do your priorities lie in terms of Renewable Energy in Colorado?

A Question from a White Conservative,"Before anyone gets upset at my question, I should note that I’m asking this in an honest manner in order to better understand my liberal counterparts.

The question I have is regarding ‘privilege’ and it’s association with white people in particular. From what I understand, privilege is the ability for a person to have an unspoken leg up on others due to the societal and institutional history that has supported that person. My question is: Why is it that only white people are associated with privilege? Why aren’t people calling for the abolition or recognition of “Asian privilege” or “Indian privilege”, when statistically speaking, both of those groups are far more likely to make more money, have higher IQs, and are much less likely to end up in prisons for any number of crimes?

However, today I noticed something very weird and stupid. I went to the table to get checked in and get my ballot. The lady didn't even ask for my state ID like a driver's license or passport. She just asked for my last name and where I lived, and took my word for it.

Now, I don't lie since I am a responsible and honest member of the American people. She gave me my own ballot and I went about voting.

However, this makes me wonder. My illegal neighbors know my last and where I live. They can always take my ballet at the polls and vote for whoever would let them stay in America like the liberals.

This is very unacceptable. We need to protect our polls since #VOTING IS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT OF THE AMERICAN DEMOCRACY.

An illegal can take my voting ballet, and I don't want that.

They don't deserve my right to vote since they don't live here. They don't pay taxes. They aren't American! This isn't their country!

I also tried calling ICE to come take those illegal, drunk, lazy unemployed, loud music playing at 2 AM, weed smoking, smelly non American neighbors.

Republican Logic,"I’m a Democrat from Texas. I was talking to my Republican (I use the term loosely, as she blindly follows whoever my grandpa says they’re voting for, and has no idea what any candidate she’s voting for supports) on the phone while watching the election results.

She tells me that she heard on the news there was a larger turn out of Hispanic votes for this midterm election that there was the presidential election. I said, “So? That’s great! I heard the college vote is way up, too!” She replies, “Well, obviously they’re just a bunch of illegals voting.” Now, obviously if there’s reports of a larger Hispanic vote, these would be verified votes, not to mention that you’re required to provide photo I.D. when voting in Texas.

I could use some help with my brother,"So my little brother describes himself as a centralist or a libertarian. He didn't vote for Trump in 2016 and didn't vote Republican or Democratic in the mid terms. But when we were talking the other day he expressed some issues that are pretty radical right wing. 

He said something about how awful the state of the country would've been under Hillary and I said well it isn't much better currently. He said ""I'm 100% certain she would've sold us to the North Koreans or we would all be dead."" 

I tried to steer the conversation thinking he was just speaking big and didn't really mean what he was saying but when we came back to it and I said ""that's ridiculous, we wouldn't all be dead if she had won."" He reiterated it and then added, ""If she had won I know there are many who feel like I do that we would've had to do something to physically take her out."" 

I told him he sounded radical. He spent 4 years in the marine corps and was on ship right off shore of Libya when the Benghazi incident happened. I cannot imagine being there and seeing and hearing the gunfire and mortars and knowing American's are dying and not being able to help in any way. But he, like others, blame Hillary and say that she did it intentionally and gave the information to top officials for the purpose of having our fellow Americans killed. Of course this is crazy talk.

Educational and political establishment is absolutely failing communities with high violence,"A female student hit a teacher in the face in Baltimore. According to at least a comment, this is a regular occurrence. The school system and the political establishment for some reason have failed to stem the violence in communities. One has to ponder why is this? Are there too many people who commit violence that are not educated in the communities? Is there widespread incompetence in educational and political authorities? Is there a chronic lack of sufficient resources? Whatever is happening needs to change. It is not possible that high violence levels get to be accepted as something normal in these communities. There should be a complete assessment of the situation in these communities, the factors at play, what role can schools and government play in cutting off the vicious cycle of violence, what resources do they need, be provided with enough resources, and workers and officials who can be role models and be competent enough to conduct their tasks. 

A few suggestions dealing with violence in schools:

1. Any student found guilty of physically attacking another person in an unacceptable manner should be jailed for seven days in solitary confinement. Jailing a student to socialize with others in jail is actually counterproductive because in such environments, the most violent inmates are the ones most popular and respected, so the violent tendencies of the students are actually just reinforced.
2. After the seven days, the student should be assessed by a mental health team and be treated if need be for a limited period of time (psychiatry is prone to abuse sadly, so it must be limited), with methods that don't infringe upon the human rights of the student, and which include anger-management and conflict resolution classes. If the student gets to be an inpatient, the student should not be held for more than a month.
3. Release the student with probation of two years.
4. Monitor said student for a period of six months after release.
5. Give incentives to the student not to be violent.
6. Address domestic or external issues that may turn the student violent, such as violent parents, violent siblings, violent people in the street or in the classroom.
7. Acquaint the students of the consequences of attacking another person.

So if household income double today from 50 years ago, but there is a 50% increase in two earner households, then that hides the per capita personal income gains in the economy does it not?

Why is it not ok to be white?,"Hello everyone! This is something that has been hard on my mind and is seen through national news, state news, and even in my own local community. So I am a whites female from the Deep South just as a little background, and I grew up with biracial parents (mom is white, step father is black) and I never truly saw a HUGE difference between myself and my neighbors which ranged from anything from white to black to Hispanic to asian to anything in between, at least until my adulthood. So in the world, see a lot of pro-POC content (which is awesome!) but the absolute influx of anti-white material is hardening my heart. I see it in the news, on Reddit, at work, social media; it feels like it is everywhere! 

I work with the public (a very half and half mix of black and white) and I just as easily serve and take care of POC and non-POC, partially because of my upbringing, and my day to day interactions (for the most part) it doesn’t really come up often. 

My boyfriend is conservative (and I’m liberal, obviously), and between his influence and seeing it in the news, and online, it really feels like it’s turning into a very anti-white America. I see all the time about how white is ugly, white people are bad, white people need to “get what’s coming to them”. 

And what truly sparked it all was a black peer of mine (that I actually adore and love his music and stuff he posts on IG) went on a tirade about how he couldn’t wait until he got his own “white slave” one day and the comments were mostly positive and all from his own black peers. Know I’ve seen him say very pro-black stuff (which he should! He’s celebrating himself and his fam!) but I found that very inappropriate and hurtful. I didn’t unfollow him because I still like his content, but it still left this sick feeling in my stomach.

TLDR: I’m white in a seemingly (and increasingly) anti-white world and I don’t want have a hard heart to people who are different than myself even though it feels like I’m continuously told that I’m bad and wrong.

Thanksgiving conservative arguments,"I successfully managed to avoid arguing with my family members about politics, and pretty much sat back and let them spew their talking points un-challenge. Being that my family is from and still lives in the bay area of California, we pretty much are all on the same page on social issues; they only talked substantially about pensions of government workers, government waste, the end of prop-13 (2% annual limit on property tax increases), the unfairness and safety risk of illegals coming in from the southern border.

The only way that we stop this man's agenda or stop him being reelected in 2020, is to stop printing his name in mainstream media and start discussing his policies as part of the current GOP or Republican party. I mean that we have to stop printing, saying, covering his every stupid word and thought.

He got elected based on people just repeating his name over the years on tv and no substance. He is now a cult personality of name and nothing else. We know that he can lie cheat and do whatever he wants and his followers don't care so we have to make him irrelevant in order to continue with the Democratic process.

So we have to stop covering every single dumb shit thing he says and just package it in with part of the Republican plan for the country and instead focus the media on Democratic candidates and what they are doing and what their policies are and avoid the actual name at all costs.

This is some Voldemort level shit I understand however I honestly think this is the best way to defeat him permanently and swiftly.

Stop with the name, stop with the brand, stop giving a fuck about him and focus on someone else. Your local senator for example is the best place to start and keep printing stories on them.

A police officer admitted to me that he racial profiles,"Hello, r/Liberal. I was searching for a subreddit to share this story, and I decided that this subreddit would reach the most people. The BLM and racism subreddits are pretty slow moving from the looks of things, and other options I was looking into were geared more towards politics. 

Let me start by saying that I'm a moderate-right individual. I support Donald Trump as the President of the United States of America because I'm an American. He wasn't my candidate of choice (I supported Marco Rubio). When the field got narrowed down to Clinton vs Trump, I decided not to vote at all. My support for Donald Trump isn't blind support (i.e. I don't support his every move, every statement, and every breath he takes), but I do believe some of his controversies and the racist claims are overblown due to partisan politics, much like we saw when Obama was President, with the far-right completely overblowing many of his controversies and creating false narratives to demonize him. I was happy to be over the eight years of Obama, however.

So now you know a little bit about me, and hopefully this sheds a light on the fact that the extreme pictures we as a people tend to paint of the ""other side"" isn't based on reality of the majority. 

And now to a situation at work that completely blew my mind, as it was so blatantly racist and appalling. 

I recently started a new job as a gas station attendant. A couple of months ago I left my long time job due to some harassment issues, and so I needed to stop the bleeding until I can get back into my field elsewhere. This store is in a small, white, conservative town. The locals and the police like to hang out in the store and drink coffee. I had to work Thanksgiving night, which wasn't so bad because the store was dead because of the holiday. One of the police officers stopped in to chit chat and drink coffee. He began talking about a black man that came from a sister store the other day to help out at our store. He then went on a weird, racist tangent about how three black people live in the town on such and such street. He said he's sure they're ""dope smokers"" who are ""probably selling drugs and are probably involved in illegal activity"" but that he can't do anything to them until someone can prove it...and nobody in town can prove it. He drives down that street often to ""keep an eye on them."" So, to be clear, they don't have encounters with law enforcement, they aren't actually, truly suspected of any crimes, but because of their race the police are assuming that they're drug addicts who are involved in some sort of criminal circle, and they're going out of their way to look for anything to pin on them.

This absolutely blew my mind. I know there are racist cops, but to have one in my store admitting racial profiling to me like it's no big deal was the most bizarre and appalling thing. Racist police are more prevalent than some people like to admit, as well as racist communities. I feel so bad for these people. The town is racist, the small police force they have is racist. There's nobody to stop these people from profiling them. I really suspect they will eventually pin something bogus on them. And shockingly (or perhaps not), I live in north, not the south!

[META] Lets talk about how to handle fellow liberals(?) who perpetuate conspiracy theories and advocate violence (real or implied),"Hey guys!  I've started seeing more and more apparently liberal people calling for Trump and cronies to be ""strung up"" or that they are intentionally hiring pedofiles to abuse the kids in concentration camps.  I think we need to have a conversation about not becoming what you hate. 

Calling for violence is never justified and ONLY serves counter purpose to what you're trying to accomplish.  I know we are all mad and fed up and frustrated.

Lets also ask ourselves if we are being caught in foreign propaganda when these things are suggested. (maybe thats all im seeing in the first place honestly)

How do you feel about the Current State of the Democratic Party?,"First, I'd like to give some context as to the perspective this question is coming from - I'm an Independent, solidly on the Right-Wing of the political spectrum, and a Social Moderate (e.g. I support Gay Rights and I'm pro-Choice, and I also support Gun Rights). I've been studying political and economic theories for a little over a decade, and I've come to dislike and distrust both of the major political parties here in the U.S. over the course of the past few years.

Both sides have seen mounting anger and insults thrown back and forth at each other, which has had a negative impact on the American public as well.

Why the sexual assault allegations should not have mattered to anyone,"TL;DR at the bottom

Of course, criminal allegations should be taken seriously and dealt with through the proper means. However, for the purposes of confirming or denying Kavanaugh a seat on the supreme court, the allegations should have changed the minds of almost no one. Brett Kavanaugh’s record is atrocious and based on that alone, he should have never been given an opportunity to be able to serve on the supreme court.

[The Washington Post article where Christine Blasey Ford came forward with her allegations](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/california-professor-writer-of-confidential-brett-kavanaugh-letter-speaks-out-about-her-allegation-of-sexual-assault/2018/09/16/46982194-b846-11e8-94eb-3bd52dfe917b_story.html?utm_term=.21f82cb52c55) was published on September 16th. In an effort to further prove my point that Brett Kavanaugh should have been struck down the instant he was nominated, all of my references have been published before that date.

First is the low-hanging fruit of [Brett Kavanaugh siding with ISP’s and the killing of the FCC’s 2015 net neutrality rules.](https://www.cnet.com/news/kavanaugh-defends-his-net-neutrality-dissent-in-senate-hearing/) I don’t feel I need to go into much detail about how shitty of a person one must be to side against [**83% of the American people**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/12/12/this-poll-gave-americans-a-detailed-case-for-and-against-the-fccs-net-neutrality-plan-the-reaction-among-republicans-was-striking/?utm_term=.fa81858fb59e) and that hiding behind a veil of “just following precedent” is utter horse shit.

This alone should be disqualifying.

Even more importantly, however, is the fact that [Kavanaugh is totally complacent with the NSA metadata program](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/09/even-after-nsa-metadata-program-revised-kavanaugh-argued-in-favor-of-it/) and is okay with the government conducting warrantless spying on its citizens and infringing on their fourth amendment rights. There are a depressing number of politicians in Washington who share Kavanaugh’s unconstitutional view, and it is one that could cause the most damage to America as a whole if and when cases of government overreach come before the supreme court. With the Trump administration rolling back already ludicrously subpar internet protections, such as [allowing companies to sell your data to third parties without your consent](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-signs-measure-let-isps-sell-your-data-without-consent-n742316), it is chilling to think what further privacy rights could be diminished.

This alone should be disqualifying.

Speaking of the president, something else deeply un-American is [Brett Kavanaugh’s views on whether or not the president should be “distracted by civil lawsuits, criminal investigations or even questions from a prosecutor or defense attorney while in office”.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/top-supreme-court-prospect-has-argued-presidents-should-not-be-distracted-by-investigations-and-lawsuits/2018/06/29/2dd9c1cc-7baa-11e8-80be-6d32e182a3bc_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.608121b19181) This right here is the exact reason I think Judge Kavanaugh was selected by Donald Trump. Although I am not the biggest proponent of the Mueller probe (I think there are ***many*** other issues with the president that, if pursued in a court of law, would benefit the American people more), there is no question that the president should not have the power to simply fire an investigator for whatever reason he/she wants. That would mean we have a dictator as the leader of our country and they could simply stop any investigation into crimes they may have committed. So with Kavanaugh on the court, Trump could do much more than end the Muller investigation. He could do, well, anything he wanted really.

This alone should be disqualifying.

Also high up on my ya-done-fucked-up-mate list is [Brett Kavanaugh posing a threat to reproductive rights.](https://www.thecut.com/2018/07/brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court-abortion.html) Although he hasn’t outright said he will overturn *Row* v. *Wade* (unlike some other judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals ***cough*** William Pryor is an asshat ***cough***), he played a key role in a [highly publicized case](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/10/immigrants-abortion-is-a-constitutional-hellhole-for-trump.html) last year where he voted to deny an undocumented teen an abortion. Kavanaugh suggested that letting the 17-year-old go through with the procedure would make the government “complicit” in something it finds morally objectionable. This is a steaming pile of unconstitutional garbage stacked so high that the stench of it alone should notify the American people that this man does not care about upholding the rule of law and it is very possible Kavanaugh could slow or even roll back progress made for reproductive rights.

This alone should be disqualifying.

The last entry onto my immediate disqualification list is how [Brett Kavanaugh has completely mishandled cases regarding the separation of church and state.](https://www.aclu.org/blog/religious-liberty/can-wall-between-church-and-state-survive-brett-kavanaugh) I’m not usually one to use the argument *”The year is 20XX, come on man get with the times”*. But… damn this one baffles me. Kavanaugh has repeatedly sided with watering down protections of church and state, specifically in schools, and, especially as an agnostic who has developed an eye for this backwards bullshit, I feel this should be the easiest issue to refute as it is most clearly laid out in the U.S. constitution. I mean, it is 2018 after all.

This alone should be disqualifying.

The next two problems are not *necessarily* end-all-be-all issues, as they deal more in technicalities with the law, however, there is still potential for these things to branch out and become much, much larger conflicts for the American populous to face. First is [how skeptical Kavanaugh is in regards to government regulations, particular environmental ones.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ucenergy/2018/09/06/what-would-a-justice-kavanaugh-mean-for-environmental-law/#2a7a4fc263cb) He has demonstrated that he wants to give industries as much power as possible to attack the EPA and to prevent the EPA from efficiently carrying out it’s duties. In an administration that has already taken a firm stance against combating climate change, this is frightening.

Also troubling is [the stance Brett Kavanaugh took on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/25/amy-klobuchar/trump-brett-kavanaugh-scotus-cfpb-unconstitutional/), stating that it is structurally unconstitutional. Now this one is difficult because it could either be the least concerning on this list since, again, it’s mostly a technicality. OR it could **by far** be the one that could lead to the most devastation not only to America, but to the entire globe in fact. Basically, the CFPB was established after the great recession of 2008 in an effort to help Americans from becoming defrauded or taken advantage again from businesses that basically broke the Earth less than a decade ago. They’ve given billions of swindled dollars back to the taxpayers and is one of the best things president Obama did during his 8 years. However, Kavanaugh has ruled that the CFPB is structurally unconstitutional. He went so far as stating the head of the CFPB is more powerful than even the speaker of the house and second only to the president, which is beyond laughable. While Judge Kavanaugh did not outright say the entire CFPB was unconstitutional, he has called for reform that would cripple the bureau and that could easily accelerate another financial crisis.

Although I do not feel these views are completely damning for a chance at a supreme court seat, they certainly don’t aid in bringing America out from under the foot of large multinationals that pose a litany of threats to the wellbeing of the taxpayers and the entire world.

Let me reiterate, sexual assault accusations should be dealt with by whatever the proper means may be. My heart goes out to all of those who have been a victim of these particularly heinous actions. However, the accusations presented by Dr. Ford should not have been the straw that broke the camel’s back. In fact, according to Mr. Kavanaugh’s record, that camel had been tuned to dust years ago from the amount of unfettered, unconstitutional, un-American bullshit that has been thrown on top of the helpless creature.

Fuck you, Brett Kavanaugh.

TL;DR Kavanaugh has an awful and un-American track record that was well established before Dr. Ford came forward and thus the circus of the last few weeks should have been moot... should have been.",Liberal,laundrysauce9000,25,1,2018-10-04,566,"Why the sexual assault allegations should not have mattered to anyone TL;DR at the bottom

Of course, criminal allegations should be taken seriously and dealt with through the proper means. However, for the purposes of confirming or denying Kavanaugh a seat on the supreme court, the allegations should have changed the minds of almost no one. Brett Kavanaugh’s record is atrocious and based on that alone, he should have never been given an opportunity to be able to serve on the supreme court.

[The Washington Post article where Christine Blasey Ford came forward with her allegations](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/california-professor-writer-of-confidential-brett-kavanaugh-letter-speaks-out-about-her-allegation-of-sexual-assault/2018/09/16/46982194-b846-11e8-94eb-3bd52dfe917b_story.html?utm_term=.21f82cb52c55) was published on September 16th. In an effort to further prove my point that Brett Kavanaugh should have been struck down the instant he was nominated, all of my references have been published before that date.

First is the low-hanging fruit of [Brett Kavanaugh siding with ISP’s and the killing of the FCC’s 2015 net neutrality rules.](https://www.cnet.com/news/kavanaugh-defends-his-net-neutrality-dissent-in-senate-hearing/) I don’t feel I need to go into much detail about how shitty of a person one must be to side against [**83% of the American people**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/12/12/this-poll-gave-americans-a-detailed-case-for-and-against-the-fccs-net-neutrality-plan-the-reaction-among-republicans-was-striking/?utm_term=.fa81858fb59e) and that hiding behind a veil of “just following precedent” is utter horse shit.

This alone should be disqualifying.

Even more importantly, however, is the fact that [Kavanaugh is totally complacent with the NSA metadata program](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/09/even-after-nsa-metadata-program-revised-kavanaugh-argued-in-favor-of-it/) and is okay with the government conducting warrantless spying on its citizens and infringing on their fourth amendment rights. There are a depressing number of politicians in Washington who share Kavanaugh’s unconstitutional view, and it is one that could cause the most damage to America as a whole if and when cases of government overreach come before the supreme court. With the Trump administration rolling back already ludicrously subpar internet protections, such as [allowing companies to sell your data to third parties without your consent](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-signs-measure-let-isps-sell-your-data-without-consent-n742316), it is chilling to think what further privacy rights could be diminished.

This alone should be disqualifying.

Speaking of the president, something else deeply un-American is [Brett Kavanaugh’s views on whether or not the president should be “distracted by civil lawsuits, criminal investigations or even questions from a prosecutor or defense attorney while in office”.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/top-supreme-court-prospect-has-argued-presidents-should-not-be-distracted-by-investigations-and-lawsuits/2018/06/29/2dd9c1cc-7baa-11e8-80be-6d32e182a3bc_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.608121b19181) This right here is the exact reason I think Judge Kavanaugh was selected by Donald Trump. Although I am not the biggest proponent of the Mueller probe (I think there are ***many*** other issues with the president that, if pursued in a court of law, would benefit the American people more), there is no question that the president should not have the power to simply fire an investigator for whatever reason he/she wants. That would mean we have a dictator as the leader of our country and they could simply stop any investigation into crimes they may have committed. So with Kavanaugh on the court, Trump could do much more than end the Muller investigation. He could do, well, anything he wanted really.

This alone should be disqualifying.

Also high up on my ya-done-fucked-up-mate list is [Brett Kavanaugh posing a threat to reproductive rights.](https://www.thecut.com/2018/07/brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court-abortion.html) Although he hasn’t outright said he will overturn *Row* v. *Wade* (unlike some other judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals ***cough*** William Pryor is an asshat ***cough***), he played a key role in a [highly publicized case](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/10/immigrants-abortion-is-a-constitutional-hellhole-for-trump.html) last year where he voted to deny an undocumented teen an abortion. Kavanaugh suggested that letting the 17-year-old go through with the procedure would make the government “complicit” in something it finds morally objectionable. This is a steaming pile of unconstitutional garbage stacked so high that the stench of it alone should notify the American people that this man does not care about upholding the rule of law and it is very possible Kavanaugh could slow or even roll back progress made for reproductive rights.

This alone should be disqualifying.

The last entry onto my immediate disqualification list is how [Brett Kavanaugh has completely mishandled cases regarding the separation of church and state.](https://www.aclu.org/blog/religious-liberty/can-wall-between-church-and-state-survive-brett-kavanaugh) I’m not usually one to use the argument *”The year is 20XX, come on man get with the times”*. But… damn this one baffles me. Kavanaugh has repeatedly sided with watering down protections of church and state, specifically in schools, and, especially as an agnostic who has developed an eye for this backwards bullshit, I feel this should be the easiest issue to refute as it is most clearly laid out in the U.S. constitution. I mean, it is 2018 after all.

This alone should be disqualifying.

The next two problems are not *necessarily* end-all-be-all issues, as they deal more in technicalities with the law, however, there is still potential for these things to branch out and become much, much larger conflicts for the American populous to face. First is [how skeptical Kavanaugh is in regards to government regulations, particular environmental ones.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ucenergy/2018/09/06/what-would-a-justice-kavanaugh-mean-for-environmental-law/#2a7a4fc263cb) He has demonstrated that he wants to give industries as much power as possible to attack the EPA and to prevent the EPA from efficiently carrying out it’s duties. In an administration that has already taken a firm stance against combating climate change, this is frightening.

Also troubling is [the stance Brett Kavanaugh took on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/25/amy-klobuchar/trump-brett-kavanaugh-scotus-cfpb-unconstitutional/), stating that it is structurally unconstitutional. Now this one is difficult because it could either be the least concerning on this list since, again, it’s mostly a technicality. OR it could **by far** be the one that could lead to the most devastation not only to America, but to the entire globe in fact. Basically, the CFPB was established after the great recession of 2008 in an effort to help Americans from becoming defrauded or taken advantage again from businesses that basically broke the Earth less than a decade ago. They’ve given billions of swindled dollars back to the taxpayers and is one of the best things president Obama did during his 8 years. However, Kavanaugh has ruled that the CFPB is structurally unconstitutional. He went so far as stating the head of the CFPB is more powerful than even the speaker of the house and second only to the president, which is beyond laughable. While Judge Kavanaugh did not outright say the entire CFPB was unconstitutional, he has called for reform that would cripple the bureau and that could easily accelerate another financial crisis.

Although I do not feel these views are completely damning for a chance at a supreme court seat, they certainly don’t aid in bringing America out from under the foot of large multinationals that pose a litany of threats to the wellbeing of the taxpayers and the entire world.

Let me reiterate, sexual assault accusations should be dealt with by whatever the proper means may be. My heart goes out to all of those who have been a victim of these particularly heinous actions. However, the accusations presented by Dr. Ford should not have been the straw that broke the camel’s back. In fact, according to Mr. Kavanaugh’s record, that camel had been tuned to dust years ago from the amount of unfettered, unconstitutional, un-American bullshit that has been thrown on top of the helpless creature.

Fuck you, Brett Kavanaugh.

Additionally, the decision in *Citizens United v.

Finally, the security of our elections is in a dubious state.  The United States has been assailed by extremely technologically and psychologically competent foreign entities seeking to influence our elections and undermine the public's confidence in a fair electoral system.

(Rant) I'm somehow a pro-life bleeding heart feminist liberal.,"TLDR: I'm 95% a bleeding heart liberal that's somehow both pro-life and pro-choice and the only place on the internet where I thought I'd find sympathy is religiously hostile and conservatively partisan. If you want to know more details, read the full post. I'm not answering comments or replies, but I'd appreciate support, even and especially if you don't agree with me. (P.S. I think I like the TLDR's at the top of the post; I feel like I'mgiving readers an option)

So, despite my TLDR I'm already afraid of being inundated by less than sympathetic responses, but hey! It's the internet, so why the hell should I expect any less when I can't keep my mouth shut, right?

I'll start by saying that I'm a 23 year old, Christopagan, MtF, feminist, Democratic Socialist, forced to vote Democrat because in America not enough people vote Green or, better yet, Natural Law.

There is one small aspect of my political opinion that is not popular on our side of the aisle. I'm pro-life, and automatically I can hear the angry typing. 

You see, being a feminist, I do respect bodily autonomy. People in general (and those assigned female at birth in particular) have the right to give birth or not, raise children or not, use birth control and contraception or not. You should feel free to live the life you want, and sex is not just for procreation.

It's just I believe that life is sacred in the same way I believe the Constitution, the American Flag, and the right to bodily autonomy is sacred (and to allay further angry comments: the second amendment does not apply to the modern gun rights brouhaha, and I agree with Colin Kaepernick). This isn't just about abortion either. I'm also anti-death-penalty, an ardent pacifist, and there has to be a better way to ease the suffering of the sick and old than euthanasia, which I'm sure is also not too popular an opinion for this subreddit. It's a belief that no amount of debate, research, or data has been able to shake. It just makes sense to me that life begins at conception because genetically everything that decides a human person comes together. Before that, it's two different sex cells not able to do anything; after that, drawing a line somewhere between ""that's a human, but that isn't"" sounds arbitrary and heartless to me.

I've compromised these conflicting ideologies in the hopes that one day, the medical community will find a way to remove a fetus, zygote, or embryo from a pregnant person early in the pregnancy and bring it to term either in the uterus of a willing prospective parent or in an artificial womb and be adopted by a loving parent perhaps unable to have their own kid. At the same time I've recognized that Abortion in some form must be allowed in extreme cases, particularly when the pregnancy or birth is likely to cause abnormal injury or death to the pregnant individual. In addition, I'm also not so heartless as to deny single parents some kind of government benefits. I refuse to accept that abortion is a form of murder. Much like suicide it is an understandable solution to an urgent emotional and psychological problem. No criminals, no murderers, no sinners (I don't believe in that; this isn't a religious belief), just victims in one way or another. I also can't stand the idea that having a child is inherently going to stop someone from reaching their full potential. My only real issue with this political view is its contribution to already overpopulated foster and adoption systems.

The reason I'm posting this here is because r/prolife is unacceptably, overwhelmingly, unrelentingly, obsessively, and insistently religious and right-wing. I can't post or comment on that subreddit without someone calling me confused, deranged, perverted, or to go back to Russia/Vietnam/ some other former communist country, or that it's a good thing I'm mutilating myself because I'm taking myself out of the gene pool. 

Given the state of affairs with Kavanaugh, that subreddit has been hell, so I've unsubscribed. I can only take so much and I've actually been incredibly stressed about my job for the last week and a half. I'd appreciate support, even and especially if you don't agree with me.

No criminals, no murderers, no sinners (I don't believe in that; this isn't a religious belief), just victims in one way or another. I also can't stand the idea that having a child is inherently going to stop someone from reaching their full potential. My only real issue with this political view is its contribution to already overpopulated foster and adoption systems.

The reason I'm posting this here is because r/prolife is unacceptably, overwhelmingly, unrelentingly, obsessively, and insistently religious and right-wing. I can't post or comment on that subreddit without someone calling me confused, deranged, perverted, or to go back to Russia/Vietnam/ some other former communist country, or that it's a good thing I'm mutilating myself because I'm taking myself out of the gene pool. 

Given the state of affairs with Kavanaugh, that subreddit has been hell, so I've unsubscribed. I can only take so much and I've actually been incredibly stressed about my job for the last week and a half. I'd appreciate support, even and especially if you don't agree with me.

If you've made it this far, you deserve a trophy and 2 medals!

Changing party affiliation in response to Kavenough,"Hey everyone,

So, I've long tried to be the moderate conservative that you all occasionally pretend still exists in this country. I only ever broke party lines during the last presidential election. I never voted for Barack Obama, though I found him to be an alright president as time went on. I even worked for a Republican senatorial campaign.

I also worked in EMS, and saw several victims of sexual assault in my time working there. I objected strongly to Brett Kavenough, to the point where I have been permanently banned from r/Conservative over using the phrase, ""God help you"" in response to his supporters. It is for emotional reasons, I will admit. I believe Dr. Ford off the basis of her testimony, and my own personal experiences with Kavenough's alma mater. But, more importantly, I also cannot deny that this is a man who does not belong enforcing fair and impartial law.

I've never been a Democrat. I'll be perfectly honest, I still don't like most of the policies you all seek to enact, barring healthcare. But I can't stand by and watch while the division of government is torn apart. Scalia would not have abided by it. I know many of you dislike him, but if there is one thing he made explicitly clear regarding his judicial philosophy, it was a profound belief in the necessity of avoiding the consolidation of power into a single party in the three branches of government.

I'm voting Democrat for the second time ever next election. And if I am, I'm sure some others of us are doing it too. One day, I hope to see a government that represents me, but that seems far off.

We aren't all bad, all of us. In the words of Obama, there's hope.

Please be gentle with those who are still on the fence. That's how you convince them you are correct, not through anger.

My name is Mike and I am a registered Democrat and have never in my life voted for a Republican candidate. I am an native American, am bisexual, married to a black woman, have 2 kids, and spent 8 years in the Marines working in the field of counter intelligence. Even though doxxing is against the rules, if you were to do so you would see that I habe stated these things repeatedly and started this account a month ago or so because I wanted a fresh start because I realized that I, as a liberal, was unwittingly contributing to supporting child grooming and pedophile rights. I agreed with a lot of liberal ideas and values but this was the one that made me say enough, I can't do this, and re-evaluate what politics meant to me and what my values really were. 

The very first thing I did was something I never thought I would do. After months of trolling and attacking random people in the walkaway sub I did real research into it and realized that even though russian bots had tampered with the movement there were hundreds of thousands of real people attached to it, nearly a million actually, and it clicked. I went to the sub and announced I was joining the ranks. As predicted I was called a fake, a russian bot, etc. and the irony was amazing. I went back to posting in r/politics with the intention of trying to help others like myself wake up and see the corruption that they were contributing to and that the things that made them hate the Republican party and Trump administration were lies concoted by our Democratic leaders controlling the MSM which Nancy Pelosi told us they were doing last year, we just didn't listen. During this process I was called a racist, a bigot, a nazi, a russian, a bot, several racial slurs, a misogynist, a rapist, a rape apologist, and recieved private messages with death threats from liberals. Simaltaneously I was invited with open arms and accepted by Republicans even though I didn't agree with them on many topics and not once did I get called any type of nasty anything. This was the eye opener that made me realize that we, as Democrats and liberals, were the problem in this country, and after watching the Kavanaugh circus and the tens of thousands who have walked away because of it I know it was the right decision.

I know that one of 3 things is going to happen by posting this. Either A) I will be called a troll and banned, even though it's not true at all.

I'd like a very thorough explanation as to why minimum wage being higher is good for American economics, specifically emitting empathy as a reason. I believe in empathy in most cases but the net positive means that it fires back, in my mind.",917,41,875,6.821107472256465,1

Capitalism,"Hello,

I am really unsure where I fall on the political spectrum, but on social issues I seem to be very progressive or even libertarian.

Economics is where I'm confused. I believe in markets. I believe in private property/private ownership. I believe that in a lot of areas, markets are the way we can produce enough for everyone, at a high quality, and a lower price. There are some areas that don't work like that. Though. 

Healthcare will be my example. I support universal healthcare. Conservatives tell me that's socialism (which it's not, but OK). I am very outspoken, though, that I totally support capitalism. I don't want worker control over the means of production (except for co-ops and stuff) and in some respects I'm not the biggest pro-union guy out there either. 

So, as liberals/progressives, do you support capitalism? Even the more Bernie-like liberals/progressives, do you? I know he always talks about socialism, but I don't really think he understand what that word means.

This has bothered me about liberals for the past few years,"I don’t think liberals understand that making fun of Trump for his speech patterns or word choices isn’t effective rhetoric when trying to make a statement about his presidency. As much as none of us want to admit it, Trump isn't stupid. He’s not a billionaire, but he did con his way into having effectively having that in purchasing power by convincing everyone he is. Your average, rural Republican neighbor might not be the smartest person, but the one that’s worth more money than your town is, and whether you like it or not, successful and knows how to get what they want. Choosing to go after Trump for his intelligence or his thought processes is not how you convince someone to stop supporting the Republican party, especially considering that all of what you could reasonably argue sounds like BS to a conservative, and a lot of the more popular short statements are factually incorrect and simply reaching for no reason! You're attacking Trump, a person that has an absurd amount of real things to go after. It does absolutely nothing and I don’t know why liberals perpetuate this style of argument. 

The only effective method of convincing a diehard conservative to become at least somewhat moderate is by making fun of them, and I mean that entirely earnestly. This works only if you’re going after the party itself, and not the individuals that they likely idolize. I’m not saying you should just bash your friends at every opportunity, but if you bring up climate change in a small group that’s around 75% liberal, watch how quickly a conservative foils when their opinions are being made fun of by the majority of their buddies in the conversation. You can’t win an argument that isn’t based in fact against a decent majority of people who are arguing with facts. You’re effectively cornering them into embarrassment over their beliefs which has been proven to be a good way to change someone’s mind.

This applies towards sentiments as well. Call the Republican party the stupid half of America, say that it’s a bunch of brainwashed old people who just watch Fox News all day, “That guy really thinks he’s smarter than every scientist in the world,” “You’ll never see a KKK member or a Nazi support a Democratic politician for a reason.” Point out their party’s hypocrisy, do it casually, but only if know that you won’t be refuted by anything resembling a majority. Your conservative friend will eventually, and it will take time, find that you’re right.

Trump even won a nomination, campaign, and maintains a level of popularity largely on the basis of him making fun of people he disagrees with. This gives his opinions charisma. People love watching others get roasted and it’s just human nature. He made fun of Ted Cruz until no one believed he was fit to be president, and then managed to win it all. It’s not a surprise to me that Trump's been able to do all he’s done and that his style of politics has made its way into all corners of conservatism.

It’s genuinely stupid that this hasn’t been a technique any Democratic politician or spokesperson has used. It’s not unintelligent, it’s not stooping low, it’s doing the right thing by putting people in their place and forcing them to reconsider their terrible opinions and ideas. By not taking advantage of this it just shows that Democrats, and liberals as a whole, don’t want to win.

This is how you change a stubborn individual’s opinion on something. There is not one person I haven’t seen this work on and I’ve witnessed it my entire life, I’ve been a part of both ends and it’s genuinely the only way to put a stop to unfounded and stupid beliefs.",Liberal,4color,1,1,2018-10-16,554,"This has bothered me about liberals for the past few years I don’t think liberals understand that making fun of Trump for his speech patterns or word choices isn’t effective rhetoric when trying to make a statement about his presidency.

The only effective method of convincing a diehard conservative to become at least somewhat moderate is by making fun of them, and I mean that entirely earnestly. This works only if you’re going after the party itself, and not the individuals that they likely idolize. I’m not saying you should just bash your friends at every opportunity, but if you bring up climate change in a small group that’s around 75% liberal, watch how quickly a conservative foils when their opinions are being made fun of by the majority of their buddies in the conversation. You can’t win an argument that isn’t based in fact against a decent majority of people who are arguing with facts. You’re effectively cornering them into embarrassment over their beliefs which has been proven to be a good way to change someone’s mind.

This applies towards sentiments as well. Call the Republican party the stupid half of America, say that it’s a bunch of brainwashed old people who just watch Fox News all day, “That guy really thinks he’s smarter than every scientist in the world,” “You’ll never see a KKK member or a Nazi support a Democratic politician for a reason.” Point out their party’s hypocrisy, do it casually, but only if know that you won’t be refuted by anything resembling a majority. Your conservative friend will eventually, and it will take time, find that you’re right.

Trump even won a nomination, campaign, and maintains a level of popularity largely on the basis of him making fun of people he disagrees with. This gives his opinions charisma. People love watching others get roasted and it’s just human nature. He made fun of Ted Cruz until no one believed he was fit to be president, and then managed to win it all. It’s not a surprise to me that Trump's been able to do all he’s done and that his style of politics has made its way into all corners of conservatism.

It’s genuinely stupid that this hasn’t been a technique any Democratic politician or spokesperson has used. It’s not unintelligent, it’s not stooping low, it’s doing the right thing by putting people in their place and forcing them to reconsider their terrible opinions and ideas. By not taking advantage of this it just shows that Democrats, and liberals as a whole, don’t want to win.

This is how you change a stubborn individual’s opinion on something. There is not one person I haven’t seen this work on and I’ve witnessed it my entire life, I’ve been a part of both ends and it’s genuinely the only way to put a stop to unfounded and stupid beliefs.",3693,58,3634,8.214194414852564,1

The Fight Of The Century,"As the midterms quickly approach, the consequences of the outcome are becoming more and more in focus. If we cannot get motivated to the polls, in overwhelming numbers, we may not be able to circumvent the massive effort of voter suppression techniques, and gerrymandering that has been put in place.

How would you do UBI?,"I’m a fairly conservative/libertarian person but the UBI is something I’ve looked into for a while now and feel like it could work. In principle I’m generally against getting something for nothing but the idea of people being guaranteed their basic needs is something I can be on board with. My question is how would you do it and what should it cover?

So I feel like housing, food, and water are all easily yes, the argument comes when you get into healthcare and communication and things similar to that where one could argue it is necessary although by strict interpretation it’s not. I’m under the impression that if America were to do UBI it’d replace all other social programs so no more social security no more Medicaid or Medicare and no more welfare or food stamps. I guess the core questions I have are,:

Would it be money that could only be spent on such items (whichever we agree is necessary) in the same way as food stamps? Or would it be more you get a check every week and spend it however you see fit? 

Would there be an opt out or transfer option? Like if someone who’s sole or primary source of income was UBI decides they’d rather live in a better house or better neighborhood than have healthcare would they be allowed to do that?

And should it vary depending on where you live, and if so how micro should we go? Someone living in California has a higher living cost than someone in say Texas, however I’m sure there are counties in Texas that have a higher cost than some counties in California. Should this be a factor and how small should we go, state, region, or all the way down to county?

My Thoughts on Halloween and Cultural Appropriation,"The way I see it, Halloween has evolved into a celebration of our collective cultural reality.

So PC liberals need to fuck off with their whiny cultural appropriation bullshit. The whole point of Halloween is to dress up as something you're not. 

White kids can be Moana and Pacific Islanders can be Elsa. Teach them that they are NOT limited and defined by their race. Hell, you let your kids dress up as characters of the opposite sex to teach them that they are not limited and defined by their gender. Why the inconsistency?

When it comes to people dressing up as stereotypical cultural beings like the Mexican wearing the sombrero or the Native American wearing the head dress, I still fail to see the issue. Stereotypes have a history of being an oppressive tool, but they are very much in line with the cartoonish, caricuture-like nature of the holiday. These costumes are representations of a trope. A trope that exists within our collective culture and our historical media. Its fair game.

I’m a university student who is writing a story for a class project in which I need quotes from individuals regarding the current Texas senate election.Social media is a growing source for news so I am hoping to utilize reddit to the best of my ability. 
None of the information I gather will be used for anything other than the project which will only be seen by my professor and classmates. None of the information will be published. (Unless of course it is just so noteworthy that I’m compelled to enter it into a competition, though from previous work history I’ll go ahead and deem that unlikely.)

Pro-Choice is the Only Choice,"This one might ruffle some feathers, but let’s give it a try. If you want a society with fewer abortions, your only choice is to vote for Democrats. That is the only party with a platform that will actually reduce the number of abortions - access to birth control, comprehensive sex education, expanding access to health care like Planned Parenthood (most importantly prenatal care), even affordable education and early childcare/welfare/food stamps to provide economic assistance after birth make a huge impact on the frequency of abortions. Not coincidentally, these are the planks of the Democratic platform.

The Republican answer is to simply ban the medical practice, which doesn’t prevent abortions but makes them less safe for the mothers. Outlawing abortions also fails to acknowledge the instances in which abortions are a medical necessity or the least bad of two choices. It’s not a good choice, but is one that many hopeful mothers are forced to make - when the genetic or ultrasound tests show that the fetus will not survive the pregnancy or the birth. It is a terrible decision but one that a mother/father must make with the physician. Sometimes that heartbreaking choice is not available until after 20 weeks. The Republicans insert themselves between a women and her OB/GYN with unnecessary testing and sometimes force the physician to lie.

I understand that some people see this as a black and white issue, but as with most things in life, the practice is quite gray. There are legitimate, medical reasons for abortions or induced miscarriages, and they are all sad and terrible. If if there wasn’t a medical reason, this should be a decision a woman gets to make for her own self, her own body. The answer isn’t to make the women criminals or punish the physicians. The answer is to make the practice an unnecessary as possible and that is where Democratic policies win the argument hands down.",Liberal,deaconheel,4,1,2018-10-22,548,"Pro-Choice is the Only Choice This one might ruffle some feathers, but let’s give it a try.

Is a non-democratic authoritarian state the only way to maintain multi-ethnic/culture?,"I hope this post will be received with a modicum of open mindedness even if it's ostensibly at odds with most thinking here. I come here in a genuine effort to get an opinion outside of circles I socialize in.

For better or worst a place like America is what it is and cannot change. We need to deal with what we have. We are a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic, multi-racial society. America has progressively become more homogenous. I view any attempt to reverse this as fantasy. America will never be as homogenous as Japan or North Korea.

Similarly it's worth recognizing that in absence of any intentional integration, cultural, ethnic and racial enclaves automatically form. The idea that America is a great melting pot has not happened. A nation of many voices doesn't become a single cooperative identity on it's own. In other words I do not think liberal or progressive values are automatic. Holding the idea that every group should be sovereign in a democratic society encourages everyone gaming the system out of self interest for their group.

Clearly everyone recognizes these issues in America. White nationalists have a fantasy of deporting anyone that doesn't meet their inarticulate criteria. Something that's never successfully been done anywhere in history. Emphasis on the word *successfully*. Liberals think think that sovereign individualism is a stable end in itself. I disagree with both of these premises. I think there should be a third option for a non-racist society where everyone submits to a highest non-ethnic identity. This would necessarily place cultural, religious, ethnic and racial identities lower but not eliminate them.

One example of this is Singapore. In Singapore every effort is made to mix ethnicity/race/culture in every apartment block. Identity enclaves are intentionally prevented from forming where possible. People are Singaporeans first and then Chinese, Malaysian, Indian second.

Another example is [Brazilian Integralism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Integralism) this was an explicitly anti-racist fascist movement. Brazil is a great example of a society that is as diverse if not more diverse than America. They face the same issues and this was one such example.

Kavanaugh is too radical to be a SCOTUS justice. So where are the massive protests?,"We've all seen the proof that Kavanaugh perjured himself FOUR times during confirmation hearings.
In all likelihood, if he's confirmed (which he will be if nobody stops it), that will mean the end of legal abortion for many women. They're not going to overturn Roe v. Wade. What they're going to do is turn it over to the states -- many of which will ban abortion.
We're also going to see more election rigging such as with gerrymandering, voter purges, voter ID requirements, vote flipping on electronic voting machines, and fraudulent vote counting.

"I think I found a solution to the increasingly common problem of subreddit bans, but I need help. Meet r/bannedbase, an insurance policy for controversial subreddits.","BannedBase is a place for banned Reddit communities to regroup and work toward reestablishing a presence on Reddit. 

This subreddit is a solution to increasingly commonplace, heavy-handed, viewpoint discriminatory subreddit bans that are an affront to freedom of expression in a world in which political speech occurs almost exclusively on private servers. 

BannedBase is an insurance plan for controversial subreddits who face the banhammer. Here’s how it works: 

1.	Subreddit A is increasingly coming under scrutiny for its controversial views. Perhaps the admins have warned the mods. More mainstream subs are beginning to take notice and call for Subreddit A to be banned. 

2.	The mods of Subreddit A sticky a “ban protocol” to their sub so that everyone in the sub knows that the backup plan in case of a ban is to regroup at BannedBase. (Ideally, if this sub gets big enough, there won’t have to be sticky and everyone will just know that this is the place to regroup). 

3.	Reddit bans Subreddit A.

4.	An official thread will be created within BannedBase for “survivors,” subscribers of Subreddit A, to regroup and plan to create a Subreddit A replacement. 

5.	While Subreddit A subscribers plan a replacement subreddit, Reddit Admins are invited to BannedBase for a transparent, open dialogue with “survivors” for how the replacement subreddit can comply with Reddit’s sitewide rules. 

This subreddit is viewpoint neutral. This is a free speech zone. Only violations of Reddit’s site-wide rules and attempts to undermine the goals of this subreddit will be met with moderator interference. This subreddit does not care if you are right or left wing. This subreddit exists to protect dissenting and controversial opinions within the marketplace of ideas. 

If we are banned, let us be banned together. The more people who come together to support this subreddit, the more protected free expression will be on the Internet.

Why I honestly think Kavanaugh is the best SCOTUS nominee that liberals will get out of Trump *serious replies only*,"
Before I begin,m I posted this on r/democrat and got told to “fuck the hell off” by one person who didn’t read what I wrote and forever was stuck in new with 1 downvote.... the reason I posted this was not to cause controversy but rather to see other people’s opinions on what I have actually written, not just the title

so here we go

I've watched about 10 hours of cspan on the kavanaugh hearings and I'm genuinely convinced our democratic senators are being rather petty, and kavanaugh seems like a great guy for the job. He actually seems to have done more to agree with the democratic agenda than the republican one. From what I can gather, the only reason he is called a ""conservative"" judge is because he completely follows the written law and legal precedent instead of going based on his own opinion

He hasnt stated his personal beliefs on anything but he has supported the ruling of cases (in the hearing and his previous rulings) that helped

1. Womens rights (including ability to choose) In fact he has hired and mentored more female law clerks than any other top level justice, many have gone on to clerk for the supreme court, and he mentored them and made amends for them when they had personal/maternal life obligations 

2. Gay Rights - he has said that many court cases regarding this are landmark/important

3. Minority (black specifically) rights - in fact he goes to an african american law clerking club at harvard every year looking to recruit law clerks because he heard they were under represented

4. Many more - like I said, I've watched the hearings, I wouldnt be surprised if some republicans actually voted no on him after everything he's said. The first day the republicans were praising him, now they are talking less and less and less as they go on (almost like they prepared nothing but praise but now dont want to give him praise)

I think that there have been many outcries of false information regarding kavanaugh in order to postpone a scotus confirmation until after 2020 (because trump aint lookin too goof in the polls) The first nomination was probably confirmed with less struggle because there was only 8 sitting judges, there is 9 currently, one planning to retire

As for the documents ""missing"", it does take a long time to find and retrieve them, to get to the amount they have now the WH staff would have to put them out at 7000 a day. And kavanaugh has had more documents released about him than the last 3 SCOTUS nominees combined




Like I said, I’d appreciate if I didn’t just have 1 guy in the comments saying “fuck you” who didnt read what I have written because I actually want to know what people think.... so please dont downvote or comment if all you read is the title and think im some sort of conservative troll or something based on that",Liberal,TrumpetSounds,0,0,2018-09-15,585,"Why I honestly think Kavanaugh is the best SCOTUS nominee that liberals will get out of Trump *serious replies only*

What could a counter-Evangelical movement look like for progressives?,"Hey all, 

After continuing to see all of the hate and exclusion pouring out from the conservative Evangelicals, it occurred to me that it’s time for a new movement. One aligned with lobbying for policies truly based on compassion, empathy understanding and love. I am often conflicted between my “progressive” political stances, but I actually think they reconcile well with the teachings of Christ.  After all, Jesus himself was rather progressive for his time.

After continuing to see all of the hate and exclusion pouring out from the conservative Evangelicals, it occurred to me that it’s time for a new movement. One aligned with lobbying for policies truly based on compassion, empathy understanding and love. I am often conflicted between my “progressive” political stances, but I actually think they reconcile well with the teachings of Christ.  After all, Jesus himself was rather progressive for his time.

"Alex Jones, Freedom of Speech, Freedom of the Press, and Network Neutrality","The last month and a half has seen quite a bit of posting and tweeting about Alex Jones being tossed out of the social media sites on his ear. Cries against censorship have been voiced, but I find them misguided.

# Freedom of Speech

Simply put, the government will not curate speech. Many people seem to believe this is somehow freedom from the consequences of speech - but nothing could be further from the truth. Alex Jones' business empire is being crippled because people no longer want to associate with him at all. People don't want to listen, so they walk away. Companies do not want to publish his materials so they ban him from their sites.  The First Amendment is not a restriction on corporations though - only on the government and its agents. Occasionally companies do serve the government - and when they do they become bound to the restrictions the government must abide by (see below). All individuals and most companies are free to shun you if you cannot be civil, as Jones' is finally discovering.

# Freedom of the Press

The  first amendment protects free speech, but it also protects free press.  Free press means a publisher cannot be prevented from publishing anything AND the reverse - the government cannot force a publisher to publish something.

It's very important to note that when wingnuts get control of governments - be they on the left or right - one of the first thing they invariably do is seize control of the press.  That isn't simply a matter of preventing stories from being published - it also involves forcing the press to run favorable propaganda for the controlling wingnuts.

This truth made the whole social media hearings last month a farce. Any law Congress might pass to regulate what Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and others do would be a violation of their rights as publishers and unconstitutional.

Alex Jones and his following can cry all the crocodile tears they want - they frequently ban people from forums they control who challenge their views without a second thought. This power to kick someone off a platform never goes away no matter how big the platform.

And as monolithic as these platforms may seem, they are castles built on sand.  If they censor users too much those users can build new sites of their own, so long as the internet is a free and open platform and no one's traffic has priority over anyone else's. Something, very ironically, Alex Jones' opposes out of ignorance...

# Network Neutrality

Which brings me to my last point. I've seen some call for Alex Jones' Internet Service Provider (ISP) to be found and forced to shut him down. This violates the doctrine of network neutrality which forces ISP's to follow the same laws as the government.  The reason they are so bound is they are direct agents of the government by working directly on the physical infrastructure of the net. They have government granted monopolies within the various cities and  municipalities. These grants make any censorship dictate they make effectively government censorship, which is unconstitutional.

It is a violation of Jones' freedom of speech to deny him a connection to the internet.  They don't have to provide him a server or a co-location, but he can still set up a server and run it out of his own home or business. Access to the Internet in our technological age is an inviolable part of Free Speech. 

The role of an ISP is analogous to the Postal Service, not a publisher. The Postal Service cannot refuse to send newsletters (or even newspapers, though the cost by weight would be prohibitive) to people regardless of what is said in them. The analogy even goes a step further in that the Postal Service isn't allowed to even open the mail they carry, similarly ISP's cannot easily thwart transmission encryption that maintains the privacy of both sender and receiver.

So this too is a free speech issue, and the Republicans as ever have made themselves enemies of free speech by removing network neutrality.  I've really never understood this - it's the dumbest thing the right has ever stood for. I chalk it up to sheer ignorance that they don't understand that 90% of their viewers are dependent on ISP's owned by the very same big media companies they hate and rail against constantly. They are ignorant of the fact that in the absence of net neutrality those companies could take their programs off the air (Their radio feeds are transmitted to the broadcasting radio stations over the Internet). It's something that has always amused me - that they support the right of their greatest enemy to shoot them in the head (metaphorically).",Liberal,AkiTendo,23,1,2018-09-26,574,"Alex Jones, Freedom of Speech, Freedom of the Press, and Network Neutrality The last month and a half has seen quite a bit of posting and tweeting about Alex Jones being tossed out of the social media sites on his ear.

What is a liberal?,"A liberal believes in laissez faire Which is the principle of natural markets which states that **free from manipulation** people will naturally form markets that benefit themselves. Manipulation must be communaly guarded against from corporations and bad actors (theft, fraud, and monopolies prevent the rational market forces from operating) most early thinkers on the idea believed that this system for the common defense could be funded through taxes levied against renters, lenders, and conglomerates.



To be a liberal you must believe that all men are created equal and are entitled to life freedom and the pursuit of happiness.

To be a liberal you must believe in a government by, for and of the people

To be a liberal you must believe that the people have the right to limit the power of corporations/government to manipulate markets. **If you believe the people do not have the obligation to limit the power of corporations or the state you are not a liberal**.

To be a liberal you must believe the people have precedence over the state and it can not limit them in movement or action unless that action infringes upon another's rights.

To be a liberal you must believe the government is only what we make it, a collection of actions we choose to make together.

Liberals split right and left over the ownership of resources. Can a man own a river, can a man own a coal deposit. As a left I believe that a man can own a river bank or a plot of land but he must respect his neighbors he can not poison the river or dam it. (the fine point comes in pumping of a river or oil field that extends past his land and further into watershed rights AND POLLUTION)

***

The modern liberal sentiment is that roads power water and sewer can reasonably be provided for under the **common good** even though they are not for the common defense and favor different groups (roads favor the merchant group for example) **they benefit all just unequally**. 

* Problems arise when public good projects directly harm individuals (if we as a community decide to dam a river and it floods an established farm or mine how can we do it, what about the widening of roads?) These issues have divided liberals. 

* Mostly contested is the right of the group to force the individual to contribute funds to actions which do not directly benefit the individual.

A major current division in liberals comes from the questions posed by futures and derivative markets and their ability manipulate other markets.

A major current division in liberals comes in the validity of ""poverty floor"" actions as falling under common good.

A current topic of debate is what actions are permissible in regards to 'a proposed right of commerce and labor' (Do we have the right to be served do we have the right to be employed)

**Apparent divisions based on corporate rights and immigration are not divisions of liberalism** as the stances taken by these groups are in conflict with the core of laissez faire any modification of which results in a new philosophy whatever they may name themselves.

The Psychology of the Common Trumpanzee,"Ever post something and then some Trumpanzee responds with an easily debunkable argument you’ve never heard before? That’s because he made it up just then. Trumpanzees don’t have such things as arguments, opinions or beliefs. They’re doing this because they enjoy the pictures of immigrant children in cages, they love knowing that their vote is the reason someone, somewhere can’t afford insulin, and they think it’s absolutely hilarious whenever an LGBT+ person loses their job or commits suicide. 

As liberals, we often try to search for ways a group of people are somehow the victim. I’ve read articles studying how the white poor in the United States felt ignored by Obama and spat on by coastal elitists. These articles, for the most part, were written by liberals. How many times have you seen conservatives, even on Facebook, articulating this? 

I grew up in Arkansas, one of the poorest and whitest of every state in the nation, and I’ve never in my life heard a conservative articulate these problems in the way that liberals do; all you hear from these conservatives is “build the wall,” or “Liberalism is a mental illness,” usually spelled wrong.  From the Breitbart bullshitter spreading conspiracy theories to the redneck in a rusted out trailer who thinks Mexicans are the reason his life sucks, the only thing you get from these people is a constant stream of lies and bullshit. 

As creatures of empathy, we always want to help that guy living in a rusted out trailer. But empathy is wasted on creatures that have none. For the first time in his life, that guy feels (albeit falsely) that he is represented. He has a taste of power, and you’ve seen how he uses it: to cheer Trump as he locks immigrant children in cages, to crack jokes when news breaks that many of these children have been physically and sexually abused, and to call for their extermination. 

We’re products of our environments, to an extent. Circumstances can limit our choices, but not intellectually, not anymore. In the information age, ignorance is a choice. If that guy can post threats on Facebook, he can look shit up for himself, but instead he chooses to post lies just because he thinks he’s in charge now and chooses to bully people. If he’d stop being an asshole and listen to us, he’d know that Trump’s plans to increase corporate wealth are in no way to his benefit. Instead, he chooses to keep doing as he’s doing now, like a simpleton with no ability to plan ahead. He’s going to lose what little he has by the time this is over, and he’ll probably think liberals did it to him.

If he’d stop being an asshole and listen to us, he’d know that Trump’s plans to increase corporate wealth are in no way to his benefit. Instead, he chooses to keep doing as he’s doing now, like a simpleton with no ability to plan ahead. He’s going to lose what little he has by the time this is over, and he’ll probably think liberals did it to him. 

No point in saying “I told you so” to a person who lives his entire life in his own invented reality, but those mental gymnastics won’t keep him off of welfare and he has only himself to blame. ",2820,39,2780,7.944492163932159,1
Is conservatism linked to Dunning Kruger effect?,"Seriously. I have been known to change my opinions, and many stance on issues because I am open minded to basically any ideas presented to me and I think the best way to make decisions is by examining facts objectively. 

But about 99% of the conservatives I have talked to lack very basic conversational, listening, or even reading skills. Recently I was trying to explain to someone that while sea ice melting does not directly affect the rise in sea level, their melting corresponds to less reflective surface on the earth and so more sunlight is absorbed directly into our ocean which in turns increases the overall temperature, they would deny this as something ""lies from these researchers"" or that their degree in youtube browsing is somehow more credible than collective groups of scientist's degree and years of research. 

Yet these people are so proud of themselves, they truly believe, with their lack of scientific knowledge and common sense that are symptoms of their lack of education, they are somehow ""superior"" to their liberal counter parts. They are unwilling to listen and have a civil discussion yet they brand liberals as radicals. 

This is something I honestly don't understand, and if this wasn't happening to almost half of the country I would not hesitate to call conservatism a mental illness.",Liberal,killerofpain,59,16,2018-08-05,626,"Is conservatism linked to Dunning Kruger effect?

Difference between FusionGPS and Russian involvement?,"Honest question I’ve been Mulling over for awhile (see what I did there?). Asking because I am a Liberal and have been trying to understand some on the Right’s viewpoint about why the real scandal is the FusionGPS report and leak (namely family).

So, accepting any campaign contribution from a foreign actor is illegal. How would Steele (a foreign agent) being hired by FusionGPS (an American intermediary) for dirt on an opponent that was released to the media be any different than if an American intermediary not directly part of the Trump campaign (because this is where we are currently), coordinated with the Russians for dirt and release?

Starting out, I see a couple differences:

1. One was paid fair market value for, the other was not at all. If the Trump campaign paid an American intermediary, who in-turn “hired” Russia to implement all their shenanigans, would this have made a difference? Wouldn’t this have made them the same type of transaction? I know they’re not, and we are talking unpaid vs. paid, but wouldn’t that put them on a similar (key word here) par if the Trump campaign “hires” Russia?

2. FusionGPS was originally hired by a Republican candidate, then was picked up by the Clinton campaign after that campaign sunk. So, it’s not as partisan as those on the Right would like to make it seem.

3. One actor’s information was obtained by illegal means, the other was not.

4. One actor’s information included copious, provable, and blatant falsehoods. The other’s has continued to be proven true and has yet to have anything proven false.

5. One was created by a private foreign citizen hired by a US company, the other was by a foreign government.

Can anyone else think of other major differences? I’m sure I’m missing some obvious ones.

What do you think about an opt in to government regulation option for social media sites?, If you have an system for social media sites to choose to be regulated by the government then I think the sites might sometimes choose it.

Looking for good discussions on modern liberal philosophy,"I have always been ""centrist"" but leaned left for the most part (voted for Obama twice), and am now getting pretty conservative. I have been watching a lot of Jordan Peterson, Ben Shapiro, etc. I really enjoy the new independent political content on YouTube.

Can someone point me to the ""left"" version of this? I want a full picture. Have always been a fan of Bill Maher but am looking for more ""independent"" stuff. I personally can't stand cable news - I want people unapologetic about their opinions that don't hide behind some bullshit pretense of being unbiased. Stuff that is more philosophical rather than details about current events.

If this is the wrong place to ask point me somewhere else?

How accurate is this assessment of West Coast vs east Coast liberalism?,"East Coast (and frankly, Midwestern too) liberalism is more traditionally Democratic, more machine politics-focused, more supportive of unions, New Deal programs, etc, and perhaps less supportive of things like environmentalism.

West Coast liberalism is often quite secular, ideological, and less tied to the Democratic Party (that is, more supportive of liberal third-parties or just being Independent).

A Plea to Americans After Yesterday,"Yesterday, despite justice being served to Manafort and Cohen , was one of the most upsetting news days I have seen in a while. As some of you may know , a missing college student in Iowa was found dead, and was murdered by an undocumented immigrant. She was a friend of a friend who attends the same college as her , so this hit me especially hard. This was a young woman who had nothing but warmth and love to give, literally the type of girl Tom petty songs are about. And within hours of this heartbreaking news emerging, our commander in chief brought her up at a rally in W.V. and used this tragedy to justify a border wall. Mollie was a fucking democrat and now , when she can’t speak out, Trump fox ect are using her for their own gain. I usually have very thick skin but this fucking broke me. 

A real commander in chief would be a healer and a leader in taking action to protect Americans . Trump used a horrific event to pull us as a country further apart along political and racial lines. This and trumps other hateful and divisive remarks are why we need to organize and vote before he does any more lasting damage to the social fabric of our country. Fox News joining in on this and using this tragedy to distract from earth shaking legal developments with Cohen and Manafort didn’t help either. 

This is not normal. 

This is not ok.

This is not what America is, has , or will be. 

We should be able to have reasonable and informed debate over immigration laws without full on fear mongering. I’m a democrat but we need to have laws so that people don’t get fucking murdered. 


We need to make sure we never ever again let our politics become so toxic and tribal that we can’t be torn apart by a cancer like trump again. Every second this prick spends trolling us is a second that problems in this country are not being solved. That’s the stakes here, this shit is very very real. 


Have a reverence for how real and sick what trump is doing is.

Love your fellow Americans and treat them with dignity.  Please don’t feed the fire of anger , we are better than using a dead girl for political gain. Go out and vote and make a difference, then hug a Republican.

And I stated that I generally support his presidency, and left it at that. Now she obviously didn't because she kept bringing up reasons why he was a terrible person.

They just simply hated Clinton for one reason or another, mostly all bullshit propaganda. My mother even said she would have voted for Bernie. Then Trump won.

"Ask /r/liberal - a simple idea to help change America from within, what do you think?","I keep thinking about what can I do to do some good in this world and make some positive change. I have a friend who managed to make an amazing impact by creating soccer in the streets in Atlanta. He gets kids (minorities and poor socio economic background) free and local soccer training by getting a soccer field on the roof of a local busy train station. https://www.soccerstreets.org

This has a lot of great results and he is doing a really positive impact. 

This got me thinking, what can I do to help the world? I can’t play soccer and I live in the border of a very rural area in Georgia. 

I’m an immigrant, work in tech in a big company, work from home, make a pretty decent living, own my house, and all in all living the American dream. But every time I go to Walmart, Target, Starbucks, a local iHop, I keep seeing more and more cases of people that should be in retirement age but still work as they lost their pension in the 2008 financial crisis. I own an investment home in a more rural area, and my tenants seem to be living paycheck to paycheck. 

I decided to learn more about the life in rural America, that place where the so called Trump core lives, where you only see a lot of pickup trucks, guns, tattoos, teen moms, conspiracy theorists, confederate flags and a predominantly white population. 

The real picture of course is not the cliche above, every time I talk to someone when I travel north, to places with population 200 and 30-40% living in poverty, and a median household income of $20,000 or less, when looking through the stereotypes I find genuine warm people who are just fed up with everything. Some don’t even believe Trump would be able to change everything but for them it’s a big up yours to the elites. Can’t beat them, let’s piss them off. And trump pisses us off. The post fact era needs to be looked at in a different way. It’s not just choosing to believe trump and fox and friend because you are stupid, it’s because other outlets are calling you stupid. It’s a matter of stolen pride, of feeling defeated. There is no logic here. It’s a big FU to the rest of us. This is why Trump won even though all the things that in any normal campaign would end a candidates political career forever. He was the only one who made them feel good about themselves and what they believe in. It doesn’t matter if 100% of his policy is actually hurting them. It’s a matter of lost pride. He is telling them they are right, that the coal jobs got lost due to stupid climate change nonsense form China, and they want to believe, he says they lost their jobs due to Mexicans and they want to believe because it’s taking away the pain from the thought that there is no one to blame but the greedy financial institutions. 

Like any person they want a roof on their head, food, a sense of purpose, hope, a sense of belonging and pride. 

Trump gives them that. 

But we can give them that too, the forgotten people that trump hugged repaid him by listening to and buying his (many times easily proven) false claims. 
People believe to people they like. Facts alone don’t really help as people believe to what they want to believe and they will find evidence to support it just to feel good about themselves.

So here is my plan. I want to help the forgotten man and women of America with not just empty promises of a wall, or getting back coal mines to work. I want to help them adopt the changing economy and skill set. I want to help them as I think that no one really cares about them. We see them as a bunch of racist, science haters, Fox News watchers, religious fanatic losers that blame their problems on the wrong things. Many people look down on them. And they have no empathy, they are mostly white, not a monitory, not immigrants, they get no empathy from almost no one. But if I can generalize something as vague as “rural America”, regardless of race or religion, I won’t be needing a lot persuasion to claim they are one of the poorest demographic in the country. 

So what do I suggest? Volunteering in rural America. I am pretty sure that if I offer a free or symbolic STEM camp after school in a poor southern SomethingVille with pop 300 and only a local hospital as the main employer with 90% trump voters, 60% high school grad rate and median income of 15k, I will be flooded in signups. 

Kids learn science in school I assume in any public school but adding more fun after school STEM activities from someone with some different views can definitely help. Teaching kids about science which includes learning researching on their own, looking and several views, fact based debating, in a fun way can make a difference.

Another volunteer program I plan is teaching young adults who are interested in a career change to more modern skill sets. I can teach IT skills that don’t need a bachelor degree. Most bootcamp programs are in the big cities and many are not aware or believe they can get into IT. I can teach programming, cloud, cyber security, and even AI and machine learning. I can get people prepared to online bootcamps, interview prep, finding outsourced work etc. there is a $4000 bachelor degree from university of the people I can help people prepare to and go through, and represent them and help them negotiate a job. It’s not for everyone but at least I can help a few that don’t know they have the talent for it to get a completely new career they never thought they will be great at. 

Alone I can’t make a nation wide impact but with help from others this, with time, can make a real difference. It will make the change from within.

For those that are in favor of UHC, why not start a private, non govenment controlled program in which people can voluntarily sign up for and contibute to?

Even if you want to halve that and say 15mil people are in favor of UHC that is still an enormous amount.

15mil people would give significant buying power from insurance companies i would imagine. 

With 15mil people paying into this same pot, why wouldnt a private program work? Why would you want the governemnt in charge? Could it act like a crdit union where the reps are voted in etc.?

"I’m a conservative student at a liberal university — I had been back and forth between parties, but have (relatively) recently cemented most of my beliefs in libertarianism and conservatism. Let’s chat!","Hey everyone,

I saw on this subreddit that someone had done one of these Conservative AMA’s a few days ago — I’d love give it a go. Because I’ve spent some time struggling between parties (both certainly have their issues), It’d be great to hear what you all have to say about why you support liberal ideals in the U.S. while also responding to any questions/comments you have about conservatism.

Here’s a little bit about me, if you’d like to know who you’re talking to. I come from a relatively conservative and Catholic background in the rural U.S. and now attend a liberal university where I study economics. I have always held onto some core beliefs that I grew up with, but I never thought much about politics until university. This is what led me to begin leaning toward the left initially, because those were the ideas I was exposed to (and many of my colleagues are very intelligent, not the stereotyped Republican-haters). As a result, I was a Hillary supporter in 2016. The more I study and inform myself, however, I have been shifting again toward conservative ideals. As a result, I have found myself supporting a number of Trump’s actions and decisions. This certainly does not mean I agree with everything that the current party and administration is doing or saying, but I am certain I agree with more than you all (lol).

One of my closest and oldest friends is a Trump supporter and I'm conflicted about our friendship.,"I know this is long, but there's a lot to say on the matter. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, this is the good old story about politics and friendship.
&amp;nbsp;

I knew my friend since I was in middle school and we've got a pretty close circle of friends that we drank and smoked till dawn with for years.  We've been through a lot of things and we've even worked together on an over-night shift, just the two of us, through the thick and thin of it all.  Ever since the election began, he came out as a Trump supporter and we all thought he was joking because that's the type of person he is.  He was very into the meme culture before it became synonymous with hate-speech and the alt-right. 

&amp;nbsp;


Down the line, it became obvious that my friend's support was serious and it was starting to split our circle of friends apart.  When I worked with him, we'd argue politics and there was a night where we had a very heated debate where I dropped facts and statistics and rebuked all of his positions.  I really tried to understand why he supported the things he did, but his answer to it all was *""leave me to my ignorance.""*  I'm not even kidding.  That didn't compute with me.  But even so, we agreed to not talk about politics near each other again.  
&amp;nbsp;

However, he still did or at least made remarks and political jokes in the store, and the store we worked at was basically Trump land, so that added to my nightmare.  He befriended a straight-up Neo-Nazi who advocated for Eugenics and some nihilist kid that just wanted to watch the world burn.  He wasn't white, but he supported Trump, eugenics, and everything else.  It was very bizarre.  
&amp;nbsp;

So my friend loved constantly told me how he loved ""trolling"" to get a rise out of people and on facebook, he would post his views and links to propaganda, so I constantly challenged his viewpoints.  He took me off for ""marauding"", which is really hypocritical, but he said that we were still friend and we were.  
&amp;nbsp;

We still drank and had fun, but our friend circle split and we slowly drifted apart, and because I didn't work at the same store as him anymore, we just didn't contact each other. 
&amp;nbsp;

I kinda understand why he voted for him, which is why I still reserve hope that he might reflect on his decision.  He has a very hard life and is unsatisfied with the world.  He has a kid, who's mother is a psycho and abusive bitch that doesn't hold a job and cheated on him, has a criminal record, yet holds custody over the kid.  He never finished high-school and holds 2 retail jobs.  
&amp;nbsp;

Ever since we drifted apart, I haven't talked to him for a year, but I kept thinking of the good old times and wanted to reconnect.  The last four years before the election were some of the best and most memorable. 
&amp;nbsp;

One of my other best-friends still keeps in touch, and earlier today he tried to rebuild our friendship.  He made a post about it on Facebook asking for us to make up.  The Trump-supporter friend said he still wants to be friends.

&amp;nbsp;

The dilemma is that even though I still want to be his friend, on principle I cannot accept his part in the election of such a horrible President, especially after I dispelled his views in a factual manner, without acting morally superior.  And honestly, I would have forgiven him maybe a week ago, but now with the Supreme Court Justice situation, it's like I don't know if I should forgive you.  You reap what you sow.  We're already seeing ramifications that will be multi-generational, and this is only the second year.  I would probably forgive him if he no longer supported Trump, but I have a feeling he still does. 

He's a nice guy, works hard, and helps his friends, and the only real negative thing I can say about him is his political ideology.  But if I had said the same thing about a Nazi, he would still be a Nazi that advocated for killing Jews.

&amp;nbsp;

Thomas Jefferson once said: *""I never considered a difference of opinion in politics, in religion, in philosophy, as cause for withdrawing from a friend.""*
&amp;nbsp;

However, even Jefferson didn't speak to John Adams for 12 years because of a political disagreement.  But there disagreement was a noble one, a disagreement about how involved a government should be. 
&amp;nbsp;

The disagreement I have with my friend is about the establishment of a near-fascist regime that is actively destroying civil liberties and the environment. 

&amp;nbsp;

So what would you recommend I do in this situation?  Should look past his ideology and accept the invitation to rekindle our friendship, or reject it?  If I do reject it, I would look bad to my other friend who initiated this attempt at a resolution. 

&amp;nbsp;

**TL:DR** One of my oldest and closest friends is a Trump supporter.  We stopped talking for over a year because of our disagreements.  My other friend wants us to rebuild our friendship and he said that he still considers me his friend.  I want to be his friend too, but because of my strong principles, I'm not sure if I can accept.

Ever since we drifted apart, I haven't talked to him for a year, but I kept thinking of the good old times and wanted to reconnect.  The last four years before the election were some of the best and most memorable. 
&amp;nbsp;

One of my other best-friends still keeps in touch, and earlier today he tried to rebuild our friendship.  He made a post about it on Facebook asking for us to make up.  The Trump-supporter friend said he still wants to be friends.

&amp;nbsp;

The dilemma is that even though I still want to be his friend, on principle I cannot accept his part in the election of such a horrible President, especially after I dispelled his views in a factual manner, without acting morally superior.  And honestly, I would have forgiven him maybe a week ago, but now with the Supreme Court Justice situation, it's like I don't know if I should forgive you.  You reap what you sow.  We're already seeing ramifications that will be multi-generational, and this is only the second year.  I would probably forgive him if he no longer supported Trump, but I have a feeling he still does. 

He's a nice guy, works hard, and helps his friends, and the only real negative thing I can say about him is his political ideology.  But if I had said the same thing about a Nazi, he would still be a Nazi that advocated for killing Jews.

&amp;nbsp;

Thomas Jefferson once said: *""I never considered a difference of opinion in politics, in religion, in philosophy, as cause for withdrawing from a friend.""*
&amp;nbsp;

However, even Jefferson didn't speak to John Adams for 12 years because of a political disagreement.  But there disagreement was a noble one, a disagreement about how involved a government should be. 
&amp;nbsp;

The disagreement I have with my friend is about the establishment of a near-fascist regime that is actively destroying civil liberties and the environment. 

&amp;nbsp;

So what would you recommend I do in this situation?  Should look past his ideology and accept the invitation to rekindle our friendship, or reject it?  If I do reject it, I would look bad to my other friend who initiated this attempt at a resolution. 

&amp;nbsp;

**TL:DR** One of my oldest and closest friends is a Trump supporter.  We stopped talking for over a year because of our disagreements.  My other friend wants us to rebuild our friendship and he said that he still considers me his friend.  I want to be his friend too, but because of my strong principles, I'm not sure if I can accept.

A completely honest and terrifying question,"It's entirely plausible at this point, if not likely, that Russia will interfere in the 2018 elections in ways even more brazen than the 2016 elections. They've seen nothing but massive benefits from their attack on our elections. It's also entirely plausible that this will happen to such an extent that it prevents Democrats from gaining control of either the House or the Senate, if not lose seats in both.  It's also entirely plausible, if not likely, that the Trump Administration/GOP will be complicit in this, if not actively aiding it, and at the very least will deny it/hide information/help cover it up. Trump would then fire Rosenstein in vindication, citing a true mandate from the American people to put an end to the investigation, and install loyal servants into the top positions of the FBI/CIA/DOJ. 

We're talking about a complete teardown of the principles and institutions of American Democracy, and in my mind it's all entirely within the realm of possibility, if not likely. Let that sink in.

 I personally fail to see where the final failsafe is, aside from a Supreme Court to which Trump just nominated a second Justice who will surely protect him, wnd even if they can't, it's not looking promising that he would comply with any of the court's orders.

So at that point, what do we do? Totally honest question. Protesting is entirely meaningless in that situation.

The Myth of Scandinavian Countries and Socialism,"So people always argue that the United States should look to be like the Scandinavian Countries, who have embraced socialism and made themselves prosperous.

Today I am going to prove why this claim isn't true in two regards, one that Scandinavian countries are not socialist, and two, the socialist aspects of their country is only hurting them.

So many people are under the assumption that Scandinavian countries are socialist, and are able to enjoy many features such as free college and healthcare.

For today, I am going to use Denmark as an example, but you can look at the other countries if you like.

Socalist advocates, such as Bernie Sanders, argue that we should "" Tax the corporations and the rich more like Denmark to provide free college!!!""

However, a simply google search will show you that Denmarks corporate tax is considerably lower than the United States

This is Denmark's corporate tax:

[https://i.redd.it/ee92hocy55a11.png](https://i.redd.it/ee92hocy55a11.png)

This is the United States:

[https://i.redd.it/4ncja15065a11.png](https://i.redd.it/4ncja15065a11.png)

As you can see, there is almost a 15 percent difference between the corporate tax rates between Denmark and the US.

So where does the money for free college and healthcare come from?

The answer to that is YOU.

Denmark taxes its people at a rate of 60.2 percent.

Here is the proof:

[https://i.redd.it/9t7vhh0465a11.png](https://i.redd.it/9t7vhh0465a11.png)

And this personal income tax rate isn't just for the rich, this is for anyone who makes atleast 55k a year

That means if you make around 55k a year, the government will take 33k from you, leaving you with only 22k.

That leaves you under the poverty line in the United States, which is 27k a year.

Furthermore, Denmark and other Western European countries spend a pathetic amount on their defense budget, mainly because their military is funded and strengthened by the US.

Evidence for that is here:

[https://i.redd.it/01n5xd4765a11.png](https://i.redd.it/01n5xd4765a11.png)

As you can see, not even two months ago, Denmark had a pathetic 806 military personal on duty, because most of their defense comes from the US.

If the US was to pull out, they would have to spend considerably on their defense, not allowing for luxuries such as free college and healthcare.

Finally, in the long run, offering free college and healthcare, which in reality comes from insanely high tax rates, eventually strains the country because there is only so much money to run these programs for everyone.

This strain was already beginning to show as recently as 2017, and will only continue to grow, which ironically has led to people in Denmark demanding tax cuts.

Evidence for the strain is here:

Need advice for trying to convince my father to stop watching Fox News,"My father has watched Fox News as his primary news source for as long as I can remember, and honestly seeing it and all the lies they speak just pisses me off. He is a conservative and I rarely hear him talk about politics, but he constantly watches Fox when he is off from work. He is a very smart man but quite old school- think: struggles with many computer applications. I believe that the reasons he continues to watch Fox are: 

It is what he has always watched 

He does not know at all the magnitude of misinformation presented in the program 

How accessible it is to him, with it on basically 24/7

I want to dissuade him from watching it and maybe point him in a different direction. I have never really confronted him on this topic and he does not know my opinion on this. I am looking for any advice on how to tackle this issue. I believe if I presented him with sources that state just how misinformative Fox News is, he may sway from the program. Of course, these sources would need to be very credible as he has watched this program for a long time and hes not just going to switch over a little flack. If anyone has any good articles that discredit Fox News, they would be greatly appreciated.
I would also need to help to replace his news source with a more reputable one, which is just as challenging. He is a conservative man, and I don’t think he is going to become a liberal overnight so I am trying to find more conservative/centrist news outlets that are not straight lies. Just off the top of my head I am considering BBC or local news stations on TV, but I am very open to any suggestions. Sadly, I don’t think many online news sources will work with him because the man loves his TV and is shit on a computer. If anyone has any advice/sources/suggestions, they would be greatly appreciated

My Opinion On Why Liberalism Fails in USA,"I honestly believe that the real reason so many Americans go for conservative candidates, time and again, instead of liberal ones, goes back to geography, and almost *solely* geography. America is an incredibly big country. In fact, it's almost ridiculous how gigantic it is. And the harsh truth about America being so big is that, a great deal of the people who live inside of it, tend to live *much further apart from one another* , than people in, for example, most EU countries.  

I have hung out with more EUropeans in my life, at this point, than Americans, and most of my Euro friends, even if they're ""poor"", tend to feel like widely traveled people. They have seen cities all over Europe. Some of them, like my friends in Spain right near Portugal, are regularly crossing borders into other countries. Like it's nothing.

Compare this to my American friends, and the friends I know my parents had. I know people who live 30 minutes from NYC, in small Connecticut working towns, who are in their 40s and have never seen NYC a single time. Some ppl will find it preposterous. How could they never see it? The answer is simple: In a way, USA has no real mainstream train system like they do in Europe.  They don't have it, because they don't care about going to any cities all that much. Why not? Because what is so special about 9 out of 10 American cities? They are not Barcelona or Rome or Florence. In many an American mind, there is simply no reson to travel anywhere in this country. In fact, most dream vacations here will revolve around places far from any city: The Grand Canyon, Yellowstone Park, surfing on a secret beach in California. 

For many Americans, its a ""one time every 10 years thing"" to be aboard a train. This is really just not the case in Europe.  And this really brings up a much wider point, which is that Americans actually don't know other Americans all that well. HOw could they? They live far from them. Even the American urban centers are strangely impersonal and cold feeling, in comparison to what I've seen in liberal Euro land. Once you actually see Europe, it becomes very easy to understand why they're so liberal, and we are not. 

I think its important that this is heavily stressed because so much crap gets talked about Americans, but, the truth is, they're just living by their particular geographical rules (and also their particular lack of, you know, thousands of years worth of history). In our own time now, its no secret, for example, that all the US cities are literally all blue. But these US cities still don't manage  to switch the culture completely, because the city still isn't quite the focal point of American culture, even when you're talking about pop culture. The European culture, in my experience, is almost entirely consumed by a heavily urban mindset. Museums, coffeeshops, day trips to other historical cities nearby. This is very important for them. 

In the US, its simply not this prevalent. I grew up in a very troubled  Amreican city: Almost everyone wanted to leave it. That was the main dream. And most of them didn't want to leave for NYC -- that was interpreted as an even worse hell than where we came from. They wanted to move to the deep suburbs and live....far away from their neighbors. Because in America, the only thing a lot of neighbors ever seemed to mean, was that you were probably living in the projects, or in the middle of a place that was about to break out into a gang war. US cities look like they're the ones that got bombed in WW2, in comparison to the gleaming Euro centers. I don't blame anyone whose poor for wanting to escape them as soon as possible. 

The American dream, thanks precisely to the nations geography and ""new world status"", is inherently tied up not with a sense of community -- but with a sense of escaping the community. So why, i ask, are so many people so surprised, by how hard it is, to get liberal ideas inside the US bloodstream? To me, it's sad, and i would indeed rather live the Euro liberal lifestyle--- but it's also not very surprising to me, when election after election in the US, inevitably goes conservative. So my real question i guess is, why do so many liberals here find it so unusually shocking?

Are you friends with Conservatives?,"Alright, so, I might get a lot of hate for this but I'm just gonna come out and admit it.

I get disheartened when I find out that someone is conservative, especially when I assumed they were left leaning. It make me view them in a different light.

When I find out someone is conservative, it makes me shut down and I feel like I can't talk to them about certain things.

I see them as unsafe because I see them supporting oppressive policies that do harm to others. I just found out that the 2 other members of my school club are PC. I hate that Doug Ford decided to cut mental health funding. Like Horwath said, I think its devastating to thousands of children already waiting a painful 18 months for care. It’s painful for the thousands of adults that need counselling, mental health and addictions support and crisis intervention.

"A proposal to fix American politics on the Local, State, and Federal level. The formation of a new political group in advocacy of Democracy and Delegative Democracy.","So I've been thinking about creating something lately. Call me naive or whatnot. 

I think American democracy needs radical reform. And I think the way to accomplish reform is to create our own *alternative government*. This alternative government will first act as a nonprofit lobbying interest group, funneling money to preferred local candidates. Then the alternative government will slowly ""take over"" local governments, state governments, and finally the whole shebang. 

So what's so great about the ""alternative government""? What's the goal? It's purpose will be the realization of [*delegative democracy*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegative_democracy), or another purer, more robust form of democracy.  

IMO delegative democracy is the most impressive form I've read about. In the reality of day to day life, it's impossible for anybody to actively manage legislatures, judges, and bureaucrats. The vast majority of Americans do not have the time or desire to research dozens of political candidates to elect to dozens of political offices. As a result, our Democratic process is complete bullshit. Our government is out of control of the people, because the people do not know what is happening on the local, state, and federal level. The vast majority of people are unable to manage several dozen political positions, nor are they equipped to vote on budgetary issues. 

In other words, Democracy needs to be simplified. People have enough trouble choosing a single candidate. Well, why don't we just let them do just that? Just pick one person, anybody you want, to be your representative, your delegate. It could be your mom, or your boss, or a celebrity, or somebody in your social circle. It could be yourself. It could be someone you trust to make wise decisions on your behalf. Then your delegate could take on the responsibilities of politics, or he could then pass his and your choice along to somebody else. Hell, with the advent of computers and machine vision, we could even start *splitting* votes. Can't choose between two great candidates? Elect both of them. Don't want to give up all of your legislative voting power? Then split your choice. ""The average voter is stupid"". Well, is the average politician any smarter than the voter? 

So how can we realize this? I believe we must create an ""Alternative Government"" that fakes it until it makes it. 
The alternative government will begin as a political interest group composed of any US citizen who wants to join. Dues would be first collected on a voluntary basis and would be used to target local governments and ""convert"" them to a delegative democracy or alternative system. Dues will also be used on political research to better inform its members on who to vote for. 

Meanwhile, money will also be pumped into political candidates in proportion to the alternative government's voter choices. Lobbyists would be hired as the first proto-delegates. So the purpose of the interest group would be first to advocate for democracy, and then attempt to force the actual government to vote according to Democracy's desires. 

In the ideal, delegative democracy would be able to minimize the degrees of separation between the American people and their legislative representatives. I believe that Democracy has made good choices. I believe that if Democracy was working, we would have never had to choose between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. 


TLDR: I have an idea. Do you think it could work? Is anybody interested in joining?

My thoughts on gun control,"I am a liberal gun owner, a former serviceman in the National Gaurd, and a hunter and outdoorsman(I eat what is killed, nothing wasted), and I dislike both sides of the mainstream argument about gun control because neither side knows a fuck what they're talking about.

First, my side against mainstream pro-gun control. The US also has a terrible crime rate regardless what kind of weapon is used or if a weapon is used at all. Most of our crime problems, including gun crime, come from societal issues; some of the gun control measures are treating a symptom, not a cause. The fact that violent people are out there and want to kill you over something as petty as a couple of dollars means that good citizens need protection. But it's logistically impossible for police to protect everybody, and according to the Supreme Court protection of average citizens isn't even part of a police officer's duty. Their duty is to find law-breakers, capture them, and hand them over to the courts for punishment. Defense, at least within your own home, is your responsibility and yours alone. The Second Amendment was originally created in response to Shay's Rebellion. It is based off the idea that the citizens are the militia. A lot of people don't know this, but the states can actually draft people during a time of crisis. In the case of a natural disaster, insurrection, invasion, or any other instance when shit hits the fan, the loyal citizens will be able to fend for themselves and may be able to help suppress the enemy(if it's a case of insurrection or invasion). I doubt this is ever going to happen(except in natural disasters), but I'm mostly explaining the background behind it. Now, the problem I have with the mainstream gun control supporters people is that they're doing it totally wrong. They are attacking a specific type of weapon based on looks and its high-profile use in mass shootings, despite the fact that 97% of gun-related crimes, deaths, and injuries involve handguns. They also have zero knowledge of the weapon they are attacking, and I will leave this video here to explain it for me https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjM9fcEzSJ0&amp;feature=youtu.be Now, if we're talking about banning bump stocks and certain features which can turn semi-autos into full-autos, or magazine capacity restrictions, then I'm on board with that, but low-capacity semi-autos should be legal to people who pass the requirements(which I'll explain further down). They also pull the ""but it works in the UK/Australia/Canada/Japan/insertothercountryhere"" without taking into account all the variables that exist when comparing countries. Then there's things like hunting, target-shooting and farming, but I doubt anyone would go that far.

And now my side against the mainstream opposition to gun control. There's not enough enforcement of current laws, and some of the current laws are so lax that it does nothing to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them. It's that simple. The problem I have with the mainstream opposition to gun control is exactly the same as the mainstream support of gun control, just on the opposite end of the spectrum. They're doing it wrong. They make the same mistakes of comparing countries, notably Switzerland, Israel, Austria, and Finland. Yes Switzerland, Israel, Austria, and Finland have high civilian gun ownership, and they are legit assault rifles or semi-automatic rifles that were once military service rifles. The variables they fail to account for are that those rifles come with mandatory military training and are locked up in the house with one magazine of ammo on the premise that if the citizens were called up for defense of their country they would grab their rifle and go straight to the nearest military installation for more ammo and gear and to help fight the enemy. Just as the gun control support can't compare the US to the UK, Australia, Canada, or Japan, the gun control opposition people can't compare the US to Switzerland, Israel, Austria, or Finland either.

My take on it is this: Keep most current gun laws as they are, but standard shooting classes and licensing should be required just to own a gun. Also, ban on straw purchasing with legal penalties and make regulations for storing weapons with legal penalties if regulations are not followed. And ban bump stocks and high capacity magazines(more than 5 rounds for shotguns and more than 10 rounds for rifles). I can't compare the US to another country directly, but the Czech Republic has similar gun freedoms with shooting being the third most popular national sport. They have mandatory training and licensing for gun ownership, and have less gun crime and fewer mass shootings. We already require taking licenses for carry permits and hunting, so there should be absolutely no issue with licensing for ownership. Also, reinstate Operation Ceasefire and Project Exile(They cut down gun homicide by 2/3 where they were put in place)

My state has had a tuition-free college program since 1998. How does it stack up to the demands being made by progressives?,"First of all, I’m not sure if this is the right place for this question, so feel free to redirect me elsewhere. 

In Louisiana when you bring up “free college for everyone,” you’ll usually be told “but we already have that!” 

We have a program called the Taylor Opportunity Program for Students (TOPS), and it’s massively popular on both sides of the aisle. Other states may have some version of it, too. In a nutshell, it’s a discretionary spending program that pays 100% of tuition at any public, in-state college for any graduating high school student in Louisiana that meets certain criteria. Almost everyone I went to school with benefited from it.


To provide a few more details: 

Currently the requirements for the base version of TOPS are a 2.5 GPA and an ACT score of 20. These criteria are subject to change at the legislature’s discretion, but I can’t remember them ever actually being raised or lowered. There is a more selective tier of the program that awards stipends to help offset the costs of room and board, books, etc, and a tier for lower grades/scores that pays for community college or technical school. Students can also apply this award to in-state private universities (e.g. Tulane or Loyola of New Orleans), but instead of getting full tuition, they get the average cost of tuition of all public universities applied toward their private school. 


My question is this: 

How close is this to the “free college” talking point that has become more and more common the last few years? If every state instituted this program would progressives be satisfied with that, or at least view it as a decent compromise? Do you see any glaring flaws or areas where it’s out of step with the free college narrative? 



",Liberal,rageface11,5,4,2018-06-25,667,"My state has had a tuition-free college program since 1998. How does it stack up to the demands being made by progressives? First of all, I’m not sure if this is the right place for this question, so feel free to redirect me elsewhere. 

In Louisiana when you bring up “free college for everyone,” you’ll usually be told “but we already have that!” 

We have a program called the Taylor Opportunity Program for Students (TOPS), and it’s massively popular on both sides of the aisle. Other states may have some version of it, too. In a nutshell, it’s a discretionary spending program that pays 100% of tuition at any public, in-state college for any graduating high school student in Louisiana that meets certain criteria. Almost everyone I went to school with benefited from it.

Why aren't Liberals talking about packing the Supreme Court?,"1. The Trump nominee will be seated. It will be a party line vote before the midterms.

2. There was nothing unconstitutional about Republicans denying Garland a hearing. The constitution is not explicit on the matter. It's time to get over that.

3. The Supreme Court has been right leaning for the last 45 years. They've thrown liberals a few bones with some big decisions over the decades, Roe v Wade, gay marriage, upholding Obamacare etc, but the reality is that the majority of their decisions have been conservative, especially the lower profile cases, and they have been quietly driving this country to the right for decades. That is the cold hard truth; liberals need to purge themselves of this fantasy that the Supreme Court has been good to them. It absolutely has not. And as for Anthony Kennedy, he was a center right judge who ruled with the conservatives most of the time. Stop romanticizing him and move on.

4. The size of the Supreme Court is not set by the constitution. It is up to Congress. The Supreme Court size has been manipulated in the past; quite frequently in the 19th century. Famously FDR attempted to pack the court. Just the threat of court packing caused justices to flip and support his new deal programs.

5. Our inane system of selecting Supreme Court justices is broken and quite frankly never worked that well in the first place. The framers gave justices lifetime appointments in an attempt to insulate the Supreme Court from the tides of partisan politics. This was a miscalculation. Almost immediately it became clear that the court would be as partisan as every other major government institution, but with the added exception of being especially undemocratic. And the court has only become more partisan in these hyper polarized times. It's time to let go of the fantasy that the court is somehow above partisan politics and that justices can interpret the constitution without the influence of their political biases; it's not and they can't.

In order for the court's ideological leanings to shift a justice of one politcal persuasion must die or step down while the other party holds the Presidency. As medicine has improved over the decades and centuries this scenario has occured less and less frequently. Earlier in the country's history it was at least somewhat common for a justice to die or retire due to health while the other party held the white house. However, in the last 45 years only Scalia has presented liberals such an opportunity. In accordance with our cockamamie system this should have been liberals' moment to realize a shift in the ideological balance of the court, the sort of shift that is supposed to happen every 20 to 30 years. The republicans very cynically took away that opportunity by disregarding convention, and completely ignoring the Garland nomination. Advancments in health care are only accelerating, and it will become increasing less likely that another Scalia type situation will happen in the future. If nothing is done on the part of the democrats, Republicans will very likely be cementing a conservative court for at least the next 45 years.

Liberals, if you attempt to let this system run it's course as is, and wait around like good little boys and girls who always behave civilly and don't break with convention you will be very sorely disappointed. You will watch the direction of your country drift further and further right as the most important branch of government in modern times stays solidly conservative for decades and decades to come.

6. This is not the time to wait, to be patient, to take the high road. If you attempt to take the high road this time you will see the foundations of the road you are walking on bulldozed under and replaced with the ideologies of those who do not have your best interest at heart. It's time to fight fire with fire. Stop reacting to republican dirty tricks and start acting one step ahead of them. This is a fight for your country and your livelihoods. You can't be too prideful and too scared to break with convention first. If we don't do what it takes to win, the republicans will; they've already proven that.

7. The only constitutional solution to our current predicament is to win the House, Senate and Presidency in 2020, write a law increasing the size of the Supreme Court and pack it with at least 2 more liberal judges. We need to get the ball rolling on this immediately if we want to force action from our representatives in 2020, because God knows they'll take the easy way out and just do nothing if we let them.

There’s have been divides in this country since the beginning. I think that’s impart due to the tribalism of the two parties and ideologies. But this goes further than that, I think. This is a rush to the far left. The intolerant and virtue signaling along with identity politics is pulling the left down. I’m a moderate liberal and in truly scared of the future of the party. 

All of the outrage. All of the nonsense that’s been going on by the leaders of the Democratic Party is impart to what lead to president Trump. That and the fact that the Dems ran HRC. 

I believe the majority of Democrats are moderate. I also believe that a majority of Republicans are moderate. There are extremes on the sides. It’s just that since I lean left that it’s more troublesome that the far left is incredibly intolerant of ideas different than their own with no common ground to be found. 

Where do moderate liberals fit in in today’s Democratic Party? I feel pushed out by the radical left. I feel abandoned by the very people that claim to be fighting for justice and equality. I just don’t think their methods will work. Ultimately this will lead to boost to Trump in 2020. What are you thoughts?

I don’t know if this is the correct subreddit for this but if it isn’t can you tell me what is?,"For some background info: I’m a 13 year old male in a conservative Christian school in Georgia, us.

There was a kid who used to be my best friend until maybe September or October of 2017. We used to play video games together, watched some of the same shows, and both played Minecraft. ( yup I was that kid)

Then came politics like a ship breaking apart icebergs in Antarctica. (We learned how to spice up sentences in English class this year.) We started to have some fights about politics blah blah blah. After that, we kind of became friends again but still knowing each other were always thinking about how “wrong” each other’s political views were. Then came more politics. We had many arguments about which opinion was more “reasonable” and which of us was in the wrong. Sometime in that he also accused me of trying to break his iPad which I responded: “why would I want to break your iPad if I would have had to pay for it?” He said: “but that doesn’t matter.” (This accusation came from me dropping his iPad on a couch) I always had a feeling it wasn’t about the iPad it was about being the victim.

Then there was the awkward period. We kinda just pretended each other didn’t exist for a few months. (Not passive aggressively but more like we had never met each other) (this lasted from about Halloween till after Christmas break)

After that there was a time in, I think January where I overheard him say liberals were stupid so I went over to him and asked him if it meant I was stupid and he said yes. He also has called me stupid a few more times more recently.

Also the administration is very conservative and if I told them this story I would get detention. Also if I had called him stupid I would get detention.

A Day in the life of Joe the Conservative,"""Joe gets up at 6 a.m. and fills his coffee pot with water to prepare his morning coffee. The water is clean and good, because some tree\-hugging liberal fought for minimum water\-quality standards.

With his first swallow of coffee, he takes his daily medication. His medications are safe to take, because some stupid commie liberal fought to ensure their safety and that they work as advertised.

All but $10 of his medications are paid for by his employer's medical plan, because some liberal union workers fought their employers for paid medical insurance \- now Joe gets it too.

He prepares his morning breakfast: bacon and eggs. Joe's bacon is safe to eat, because some girly\-man liberal fought for laws to regulate the meat packing industry.

In the morning shower, Joe reaches for his shampoo. His bottle is properly labeled with each ingredient and its amount in the total contents, because some crybaby liberal fought for his right to know what he was putting on his body.

Joe dresses, walks outside and takes a deep breath. The air he breathes is clean, because some environmentalist wacko liberal fought for laws to stop industries from polluting our air.

He walks to the subway station for his government\-subsidized ride to work. It saves him considerable money in parking and transportation fees, because some fancy\-pants liberal fought for affordable public transportation, which gives everyone the opportunity to be a contributor.

Joe begins his work day. He has a good job with excellent pay, medical benefits, retirement, paid holidays and vacation, because some lazy liberal union members fought and died for these working standards.

Joe's employer pays for these standards, because Joe's employer doesn't want his employees to call the union.

If Joe is hurt on the job or becomes unemployed, he'll get worker's compensation or an unemployment check, because some stupid liberal didn't think he should lose his home, because of his temporary misfortune.

It's noontime and Joe needs to make a bank deposit so he can pay some bills. Joe's deposit is federally insured, because some godless liberal wanted to protect Joe's money from unscrupulous bankers who ruined the banking system before the Great Depression.

Joe has to pay his insured mortgage and his below\-market student loan, because some elitist liberal decided that Joe and the government would be better off if he was educated and earned more money over his lifetime.

Joe is home from work. He plans to visit his father this evening at his farm home in the country. He gets in his car for the drive. His car is among the safest in the world, because some America\-hating liberal fought for car safety standards.

He arrives at his boyhood home. His was the third generation to live in the house financed by Farmers' Home Administration, because bankers didn't want to make rural loans.

The house didn't have electricity until some big\-government liberal stuck his nose where it didn't belong and demanded rural electrification.

He is happy to see his father, who is now retired. His father lives on Social Security and a union pension, because some wine\-drinking, cheese\-eating liberal made sure he could take care of himself so Joe wouldn't have to.

Joe gets back in his car for the ride home, and turns on a radio talk show. The radio host keeps saying that liberals are bad and conservatives are good. He doesn't mention that the beloved Conservatives have fought against every protection and benefit Joe has enjoyed throughout his day.

Joe agrees: ""We don't need those big\-government liberals ruining our lives! After all, I'm a self\-made man who believes everyone should take care of themselves, just like I have!""

If I can be honest, my heart yearns for these people, who take in their daily Fox news brainwashing without a missing dose, and are utterly convinced all their problems are caused by people sincerely trying to solve them. The ignorance is so deep it would take the destruction of the country for them to open their eyes . It's just so sad to me.

I've been thinking about Oliver North.,"Up front, I'm mostly a liberal person. 

I often think about ways things could go south. I think about the ramifications if the 'alt-right' somehow ends up in the victor's books as the heroes who were right all along. I think about the ways this could unfold, and lately I've been thinking about Oliver North.

As many of you know, Oliver North was proven to be guilty of some heinous crimes while holding his position, but all of the charges were dropped due to heavy political pressure. One of the biggest influences being John Bolton, who is still in office and pushing agendas.

But to many, North was a good guy. He testified in front of congress, and gave information under immunity, that was later argued to be basis of gathering evidence. And the information he gave was useful. We found out about a lot of corruption, etc., while ignoring the fact that North was responsible for much of this corruption. 

It's not as if he claimed that he was commanded to break the law, and that it was actually someone higher up who coerced him into making the deals he made.

So, if the guy is to be seen as a hero, a whistleblower, that's good and all, but we never saw any convictions. Of anyone. And it was his own crimes that he made us more aware of.

So, why would the government want to protect this man?

The conservative answer, I assume, would be that just making the public aware of the corruption is a great deed, even if nobody goes down for it. He's clearly a good guy, because otherwise he would have just kept playing ball. It's understandable that his superior wouldn't take the fall, because whoever that is must be someone who really has their claws deep, and is untouchable. And the reason North got off free, is both because he didn't tread too close by throwing superiors under the bus, and because he does know more information, and threatened to make it public.

The left believes he's a war criminal and is the person who has his claws deep into the system.

If the latter is true, we should be considering why he's suddenly back in the public eye.

Given his history, he's a perfect candidate for capitalizing on what conservatives already believe about him. It would be easy for conservatives to believe that he does have more information about how corrupt our government is. Maybe now, almost 30 years later, he is willing to out people by name. 

We know corruption is bipartisan. Some of the people who spoke in support of North in 1991 were Democrats. 

What if publicly outing war crimes was not just a plea to escape trouble, or some good deed that was done, but instead all part of the plot.

Trump, who is ""not a politician"", is the other perfect character for the plot. 

If during his presidency, an unprecedented amount of information comes out about previous administrations corruption, his base and more will think, ""Wow, Trump did it after all"".

Republicans and Democrats will be the fall-guys. It will be the liberals and conservatives who already resent the two parties who will be most targeted to have faith in the ""new-era""

And most conservative will immediately identify with this group. No matter how much the loved Reagan, or Bush. 

So everyone will be laughing at liberals and how wrong they were, while the corruption lives on under yet another curtain.

Why do some red-pillers see the rise of male grooming as a threat to manhood?,"This is one of the few things I disagree with red-pillers, I don't get it. If anything I am all up for it.

Liberals: End the excuses and finger-pointing for Hillary's loss.,"A year and a half later and we are still no further along in our understanding then we were on November 9th. She was an unpopular, wooden, uncharismatic and unfocused candidate. Anyone else probably could have beat Trump.

She had little to no discernible, simple message, no singular focus, very little likability, and no real identity. What did Hillary Clinton truly care about? What did a vote for her mean? Why should have anyone voted for her, other than the fact that she wasn't Trump?

Potential countries that could lead the Liberal world order after USA,"Now that USA has fallen to populist takeover, I want to discuss which country will now lead the liberal order. The new leader of the liberal order should have the following criteria:

1) It should be socially liberal.
2) It should have prosperitive economy and powerful military force.
3) It should participate heavily in both foreign intervention and the spread of some varieties of liberalism.

Capitalism and the free market is not a criteria since many new liberal varieties no longer support them. I will list my suggestion of countries that could lead the liberal order:

1) Canada is a somewhat good option since it persist in the 2008 recession crisis better than USA. The Liberal Party of Canada is now elected so it has become a refuge of immgrants from Trump's America. Furthermore, Canada is not a good environment for Western-style populism especially on the national level and the populism that could gain power on the national level would be more moderate. One challenge as the leading liberal order is the lack of powerful military force. Australia and New Zealand could be two more candidates within the Anglo-phone countries but I do not have enough information to comment on them.

2) Some western European countries like Sweden and Norway could be a good candidate but they are affected by populist uprising. France did manage to avoid a populist takeover for now but further victories in the future is uncertain.

3) In Latin America, Mexico could be a candidate but its puppet government of American corporate first need to be removed and fully functional democracy need to be implemented. It also have problems of human right violation, rampart corruption, widespread crimes, and mass poverty from neo-colonialism since the 1960s. Venezuela could not be a candidate despite its economic prosperity because it is heavily dependent on oil export and any disruption to the international oil industry, like the 2008 recession crisis, could destroy Venezuelan economy. Peru could be another candidate but more information is needed.

4) Cuba could be the best prospect among the Latin American countries due to the Communist influence; this include humitarian intervention to foreign countries, socially liberal policies, tolerance of diversity, and resistance toward con-man from American politicians and business elites. Cuba is a small country that is, with recent exception, heavily affected by the economic sanction from the Capitalists but this does not affected Cuba enough as a candidate.

5) In East Asia, China could be a candidate economically but its current political system is inadequent. The local Communist Party did promise to introduce democracy in the future but time will tell whether they will keep the promise.

One thing i said was ""i wish we could deport aggressive people like you"". In return he twisted my words and posted to his page stating that i was being racist towarss him because he was a black conservative.

"Does the ""BLM"" movement violate liberal principles?","I've always considered myself to be socially liberal.  Growing up, I read MLK, and Gandhi, and considered them to be my heros.  Gandhi not so much anymore, but I would say that MLK was/is my biggest political hero in recent history.

If one actually listens to what MLK said, and what his movement was about, it doesn't take long to see the MASSIVE differences between that civil rights movement, and the modern ""BLM"" movement(for lack of a better term).

MLK's ideology was that whites and blacks must unite.  He was against black power, and white power equally.  MLK's movement had more to do with improving the human race, than with improving JUST the black race.  MLK didn't risk his life(and die) protesting Vietnam JUST for black people.  He did it for HUMANITY.  Whites.  Blacks.  Vietnamese.  And everything in-between.

Compare this to BLM.

BLM holds that all white people, by the nature of their race, have ""white privilege"".  This, by liberal ideology, is racist.  Saying that all people of a race(whether white or black), without even KNOWING them, are ALL a certain way IS racism.

MLK's goal was to bring about equality, by working together, and trying to achieve things together, as one human race.

BLM's goal is to increase the black race's social standing, by being militant, making demands, and being aggressive/accusatory toward white people.

I just tried to make a post on /r/socialjustice101.  Got instant ban for a week, for responding to a kid who said that ""reverse racism"" isn't real, and that you can't be racist to a white person.  The #1 rule is that you cannot deny racism exists on that sub.  

Yet, I get banned for quoting MLK/Frederick Douglas/Tupac... he gets upvotes for saying that racism against white people doesn't exist(despite it being a clear violation of rule #1).

As a liberal, I'm getting banned from social justice subs.  Things that MLK, Frederick Douglas, and Tupac say are now considered to be ANTI-Social Justice.

I'm just thinking this is a serious divide among liberals in America, and it's unfortunate.

I'd argue 90% of people in America agree with the MLK version of equality, where all races work together, without singling out a single race by name.

But, only like 10%-20% agree with this ""all white people are X"" racist statements.

That's why BLM will never be successful... and an MLK style Civil Rights movement is needed to replace it ASAP.

What is different about the economy today than in 1960?,"What is different about the economy today than in 1960?

Automation, industry structure, immigration, and most of all the general progression of information technology which intersects automation but does not entirely overlap. Probably will not do anything about automation, most likely will do something about immigration, nobody is talking about Industry Structure and that is really the focus of my interest.

debt
• noun 1 a sum of money owed. 2 the
state of owing money. 3 a feeling of
gratitude for a favour or service.
-Oxford English Dictionary

If you owe the bank a hundred thousand
dollars, the bank owns you. If
you owe the bank a hundred million
dollars, you own the bank.
-American Proverb

Everything is a bubble because there is an overall lack of work to be done in the economy due to lack of consumers translating into lack of demand for goods and services; vicious cycle  et cetera.

Well, what is the culprit? Here is the actual right answer: Industry Structure / Core competency theory of the firm hollowing out the economy. Because Intellectual Property is the only profit center when you farm everything else out to the world, all other activities done by a firm are being treated as a service *outside of the firm* and this creates the bimodal distribution that is causing the economy to be so low for so long, because those activities when done outside the firm have an additional set of investors, additional set of people taking a slice, and leaving less room for a weekly paycheck for the same activity. Also, activities done outside the firm are subject to a higher level of competition than something involving an interview process, so in this additional way, the “lean” industry structure exerts downward pressure on wages. We are too efficient at doing work, and therefore a lot less effective at creating one additional job in the economy.

Some have argued that this new bimodal distribution (tale of two cities) is a more truthful representation of a meritocracy than a normal distribution, since we run up against risk/excellence pretty darn frequently, whereas bankers in the 2000s and 1990s and I guess the 1980s thought of risk in particular as being normally distributed, and therefore bad things go down very infrequently. Well, maybe if you are discriminating against the risky guys, and not giving them loans! But long tail risk is much more common than that. If you are not anticipating long tail risk, such as if you are a pension holder at United Airlines, and UA is allowed to default on 9 billion dollars in pension obligations to their employees / slaves. Then you are not only creating moral hazard, you are creating a situation where debtors are taking enormous levels of risk, because the creditor class is not actually taking any risk. Debts therefore will always need to be paid, regardless of whether it is a bad loan. Because the debtor is considered to be the one taking the risk, rather than the creditor. Sovereign nations are paying back debt at many times the principal. If you have payed 100% interest, a debt obligation should be considered met. That is not the system we have. All religions have condemnations against debtors not meeting their debt obligations, but they also all condemn usury. Even the word evokes images that are too harsh for polite company. 

For this reason, it makes zero sense for Trump to take credit for the economy. Obama bought at a low. Trump bought at high. So, there is more downside than upside to tethering the evaluation of the President's performance to the state of the economy, because these metrics also goes down on some years. We are also too close to evaluate, because we do not know what the future brings. There are bubbles everywhere in a world where growth is much lower than what we expected previously, when we were making investment decisions based on that expectation of growth/return. Indeed, the stock market is not the economy, and so the recent gains to the real economy have been modest. However, we talk about labor market tightening up without respect to the quality of those same jobs, or the sustainability of the growth, or the equity of the growth. The Fed is raising interest rates so that employers don’t lose the whip hand. The central problem has *not* been solved.

The biggest problem is industry structure; ie, the difference between GE in 1960 being the most profitable and largest employer, versus today where Apple employs only tens of thousands of people. But the scope of the conversation is limited to an infrastructure program built out with American steel. Getting that piece right doesn't preclude missing the part that bites your ass. Will it be sovereign debt? Will it be student debt? Regardless of the bubbles, the core competency theory of the firm or competition is what is hollowing out the economy. It's profitable toi a fault, and in the case of MSPs are rarely more effective than doing something in house.

The way out of the Great Recession is for firms to do more in-house, such as Elon Musk doing basically everything in-house, outside of farming out frame production to Thermo-Fusion in Newark. On the other hand, when firms instead engage something as a service, the activity in question becomes even more a cost to be minimized, rather than an asset to invest in (Human Capital). There is still an overall lack of demand for people to do work in the economy, and it is because there is an overall lack of consumers. The economy turns into a godless surveillance machine when the only buyers are oligarchs and governments. Anticipate a techlash against the firms who are not employing enough Americans, and importing Asians because they are better spatially, allowing those same firms not to do any job-training in-house while also investing in campaigns to make the price of software development labor cheaper, such as school programs training more software developers in public school with our tax dollars et cetera. That is far too lean. Google is responsible for Google’s pipeline of labour, not the US federal government. Maybe if they were a patriotic firm, caring about their interests would make sense. But they are not. The money has already crept in, and google is a bad actor that has never received any sort of public response, except from the Republicans. Is a bimodal distribution inherently prone to class warfare? It certainly seems the case. Attacking the big four tech companies would be the most meaningful step toward fixing our spirit, because we are only as good as our citizens. We need to hurt the people that have been hurting us. Most of all, because they are a powerful symbol of what the economy has become, and somehow, everyone and their dog understands that the automation, industry structure, immigration, and most of all the general progression of information technology that allows us as a group of skilled workers to do more work for less money. There is nothing to be done about automation or technology, but immigration and industry structure are the sorts of contours of the market the the feds are able to shape. ",Liberal,coupdetacos,4,2,2018-03-17,767,"What is different about the economy today than in 1960? What is different about the economy today than in 1960?

Automation, industry structure, immigration, and most of all the general progression of information technology which intersects automation but does not entirely overlap. Probably will not do anything about automation, most likely will do something about immigration, nobody is talking about Industry Structure and that is really the focus of my interest.

debt
• noun 1 a sum of money owed. 2 the
state of owing money. 3 a feeling of
gratitude for a favour or service.
-Oxford English Dictionary

If you owe the bank a hundred thousand
dollars, the bank owns you. If
you owe the bank a hundred million
dollars, you own the bank.
-American Proverb

Everything is a bubble because there is an overall lack of work to be done in the economy due to lack of consumers translating into lack of demand for goods and services; vicious cycle  et cetera.

Well, what is the culprit? Here is the actual right answer: Industry Structure / Core competency theory of the firm hollowing out the economy. Because Intellectual Property is the only profit center when you farm everything else out to the world, all other activities done by a firm are being treated as a service *outside of the firm* and this creates the bimodal distribution that is causing the economy to be so low for so long, because those activities when done outside the firm have an additional set of investors, additional set of people taking a slice, and leaving less room for a weekly paycheck for the same activity. Also, activities done outside the firm are subject to a higher level of competition than something involving an interview process, so in this additional way, the “lean” industry structure exerts downward pressure on wages. We are too efficient at doing work, and therefore a lot less effective at creating one additional job in the economy.

Some have argued that this new bimodal distribution (tale of two cities) is a more truthful representation of a meritocracy than a normal distribution, since we run up against risk/excellence pretty darn frequently, whereas bankers in the 2000s and 1990s and I guess the 1980s thought of risk in particular as being normally distributed, and therefore bad things go down very infrequently. Well, maybe if you are discriminating against the risky guys, and not giving them loans! But long tail risk is much more common than that. If you are not anticipating long tail risk, such as if you are a pension holder at United Airlines, and UA is allowed to default on 9 billion dollars in pension obligations to their employees / slaves. Then you are not only creating moral hazard, you are creating a situation where debtors are taking enormous levels of risk, because the creditor class is not actually taking any risk. Debts therefore will always need to be paid, regardless of whether it is a bad loan. Because the debtor is considered to be the one taking the risk, rather than the creditor. Sovereign nations are paying back debt at many times the principal. If you have payed 100% interest, a debt obligation should be considered met. That is not the system we have. All religions have condemnations against debtors not meeting their debt obligations, but they also all condemn usury. Even the word evokes images that are too harsh for polite company. 

For this reason, it makes zero sense for Trump to take credit for the economy. Obama bought at a low. Trump bought at high. So, there is more downside than upside to tethering the evaluation of the President's performance to the state of the economy, because these metrics also goes down on some years. We are also too close to evaluate, because we do not know what the future brings. There are bubbles everywhere in a world where growth is much lower than what we expected previously, when we were making investment decisions based on that expectation of growth/return.

Non-Governmental Solutions to Reduce Gun Violence?,"Hello,

Generally consider myself a pragmatist, especially when it comes to politics.

I am not saying that any kind of gun control is bad or would fail. But it doesn't seem to be a live political option at the moment. There is at least a possibility that it is not for a while.

Alcoholics Anonymous has helped alcoholics where Prohibitions failed.
I buy into the idea that we should treat drug addiction as a medical problem instead of a criminal problem.

Do you think there are solutions to gun violence that could work instead of a ban or in addition to a ban on certain guns or on certain people having guns?

Obviously, the burden of coming up with these ideas is not on liberals, it is on conservatives/Republicans. You have a solution: gun control.

2nd and 4th amendment hypocrisy,"With 2nd amendment and 4th amendment rights both being in the news lately, I’ve become frustrated with what I believe to be the enormous hypocrisy of many people’s positions on these issues. The 2nd amendment right to “keep and bear arms” does not equal an unlimited right to own any and all types of firearms. Even the most ardent gun rights supporters acknowledge and accept this; you don’t see many people arguing that machine gun ownership should be legal. Under this same logic, a ban on military-style assault weapons clearly does not contravene the 2nd amendment. The 4th amendment, however, unequivocally states that searches require a warrant based on probable cause. Thus, the warrantless searches and surveillance authorized under the PATRIOT Act and FISA Sec. 702 (which Congress voted last month to reauthorize) patently violate the 4th amendment. Yet many of the same individuals who steadfastly oppose an assault weapons ban on constitutional grounds have no problem with, and even strongly support, such blatant violations of the 4th amendment “for our own safety.” To me, this appears to be the height of hypocrisy. I’d honestly like to hear people’s rationale for how they reconcile these seemingly inconsistent positions on the 2nd and 4th amendments.

"""Killing Detente: The Right Attacks the CIA"" -Book review in Bulletin Of The Atomic Scientists. About how Nixon's Detente (his ending of hostilities with Russia) was sabotaged, resulting in U.S. taxpayers paying a huge price in Trillions &amp; Trillions of tax dollars given 2 scheming ""Defense"" industry","""Killing Detente: The Right Attacks the CIA""; By Anne Hessing Cahn

Book review in the ""Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists"" January, 1999

No. 1, Vol. 55; Pg. 70

By Warnke, Paul C. (reviewer)

Killing Detente is a highly readable account of an ill-considered and maladroit exercise in intelligence reassessment that delayed--but did not derail--detente, the process of accommodation that occurred between Washington and Moscow in the mid-1970s.

In presenting her analysis of what became known as the Team B exercise, Anne Cahn uses her extensive experience in international affairs, a careful review of many previously unavailable documents, and interviews with key individuals involved in the affair. (I should disclose that I worked with the author at the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the Committee on National Security, and reviewed drafts of some chapters of her book.)

Shortly after Gerald Ford succeeded Richard Nixon, the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) began to push for an alternative review of Soviet strategic capabilities, contending that the National Intelligence Estimates prepared by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) might be understating Soviet strategic strength. Competent analysts, however, had criticized the CIA's reports as greatly **overstating** Soviet military expenditures. **[WhereIsFiber's note: The Soviets, now the Russians, have always spent a small fraction on defense compared to our wildly wasteful U.S. ""Defense"" budgets. The USA spends on ""Defense"" what the next 12 countries combined spend on defense. That's why our economy is just limping along and our national debt has skyrocketed to 19 Trillion, and dangerously rising.]**

In late 1975, then-CIA Director William Colby responded negatively to the PFIAB proposal and disagreed with its contention that the agency's intelligence estimates erred by ""projecting a sense of complacency."" But President Ford, engaged as he was with Ronald Reagan's challenge for the 1976 Republican presidential nomination, was sensitive to possible fight-wing criticism. He eventually authorized the Team B adventure.

The initial idea was to appoint three panels of outside experts that would assess, respectively, the threat to U.S. ICBM survival created by Soviet missile accuracy, the Soviet anti-submarine warfare capability against U.S. nuclear missile submarines, and the extent to which Soviet air defenses could prevent penetration by strategic bombers.

The navy, however, considered information about the operational aspects of submarine patrols and whether they might be trailed by Soviet assets as information that could not be shared, even with the CIA. The second panel, accordingly, was reoriented to deal with Soviet strategic objectives. It is the work of this panel that is generally referred to as the Team B Report.

Whatever might be said for evaluation of strategic capabilities by a group of outside experts, the impracticality of achieving useful results by ""independent"" analysis of strategic objectives should have been self-evident. Moreover, the futility of the Team B enterprise was assured by the selection of the panel's members. Rather than including a diversity of views, as was recently done in putting together the, so-called Rumsfeld Commission on the ballistic missile threat, the Strategic Objectives Panel was composed entirely of individuals who had made careers of viewing the Soviet menace with alarm.

As the author notes, the panel's chairman, Richard Pipes, has been called the ""intellectual godfather"" of the thesis that the Soviets had rejected nuclear parity and were bent on fighting a nuclear war. **[My note: This is laughable.]** In an interview, Pipes told Cahn that he wrote most of the first section of the report, which criticized the CIA for underestimating the ""intensity, scope, and implicit threat"" posed by the Soviet Union, by using evidence relating to capabilities rather than intentions. This section argued that the really important evidence demonstrated that ""Soviet leaders are first and foremost offensively rather than defensively minded."" **[Note: Haha, if you're going to waste Trillions of U.S. taxpayers' money on ""Defense,"" you need a big boogeyman/bogeyman, a scary ""enemy,"" a phantom menace. The reality is the U.S. foisted the Cold War on the Russians.  The Russians wanted to be our ally, just like the French are our ally.  In fact, the Russians were our allies during World War 2 against the Nazis.  After World War 2, U.S. war mongers started the Cold War against Russia.  No less than double Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling has said the Soviets/Russians did not want the Cold War.]**

It is now entirely clear, however, that by the early 1970s Soviet leaders had concluded that the Soviet Union could not win, and might not even survive, a nuclear war. Anyone thereafter dealing with Soviet officials could readily recognize that they held no illusions about having military superiority over the United States and its allies. They were completely aware that NATO was a security alliance with a solidarity and common purpose that could not be ascribed to the Soviet-dominated Warsaw Pact. Even the dullest of Soviet leaders must have known that a limited nuclear war would almost certainly have meant the destruction of the Kremlin--and thus of the Soviet empire.

Detente was not doing too well when Team B met in 1975. It had been badly damaged by the U.S.-Soviet confrontation precipitated in 1973 by the Israeli-Egyptian war. In October of that year, the encirclement of Egypt's Third Army by Israeli defense forces prompted Leonid Brezhnev to call for joint U.S.-Soviet intervention to stop the fighting. Otherwise, suggested the Soviet premier, the Soviet Union might consider acting alone. In response to this muted threat, the United States called a worldwide alert of both its conventional and nuclear forces.

Although the crisis soon passed, it cast a continuing chill on the dialogue between Washington and Moscow. The Team B Report was a further blow to detente and, as the author observes, it provided ""intellectual fodder"" for the Committee on the Present Danger, which was spearheaded by former Undersecretary of State Eugene Rostow. In its first policy statement, released two days after the 1976 presidential election, the committee stated that ""the principal threat to our nation, to world peace, and to the cause of human freedom is the Soviet drive for dominance based upon an unparalleled military buildup."" **[Lol. You accuse your ""enemy"" of what you, yourself, are most guilty.]** The Soviet Union, the committee concluded, ""has not altered its long-held goal of a world dominated from a single center--Moscow."" **[The jokes keep coming.]**

Not surprisingly, the founding board members of the Committee on the Present Danger included Team B members Richard Pipes, Foy Kohler, Paul Nitze, and William Van Cleave. When Ronald Reagan took office in 1981, Pipes was named the president's special adviser on the Soviet Union and, in a masterpiece of miscasting, Eugene Rostow, the motivating force behind the Committee on the Present Danger, became director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.

Fortunately, Mikhail Gorbachev's rise to power and the rapport he developed with Ronald Reagan, beginning with their first meeting in Geneva in 1985, put an end to superpower confrontation politics and, in a few years, to the Soviet Union itself. In the interest of fairness, I must note that Team B member Paul Nitze played a constructive role in that process as arms control adviser to Secretary of State George Shultz.

Although detente in the long run survived the right-wing attack, **[this book was published in 1998 during Bill Clinton's presidency, so, no, detente did not survive the Bush/Cheney regime and the ""Project For a New American Century,"" the 21st Century's equivalent of the anti-Nixon, anti-detente ""Team B"" liars]** the painful consequences of the Team B affair can still be felt in the diversion of massive funds from genuine human needs to a grossly excessive U.S. military buildup.

""Killing Detente: The Right Attacks the CIA"" author Anne Cahn voices warm appreciation for the legal work that gave her access to previously undisclosed documents through the Freedom of Information Act. But it is the author's thoughtful analysis of these documents and her searching interviews with key players that give Killing Detente its scope and depth.

Previously we knew little about the Team B Strategic Objectives Panel apart from its report. We now know that the way its members were selected and the manner in which it operated virtually preordained its conclusions. Not only is Anne Cahn's book of historical interest and useful as a teaching tool, but it is also a valuable study of how not to set defense policy.

About how Nixon's Detente (his ending of hostilities with Russia) was sabotaged, resulting in U.S. taxpayers paying a huge price in Trillions &amp; Trillions of tax dollars given 2 scheming ""Defense"" industry ""Killing Detente: The Right Attacks the CIA""; By Anne Hessing Cahn

Book review in the ""Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists"" January, 1999

No. 1, Vol. 55; Pg. 70

By Warnke, Paul C. (reviewer)

Killing Detente is a highly readable account of an ill-considered and maladroit exercise in intelligence reassessment that delayed--but did not derail--detente, the process of accommodation that occurred between Washington and Moscow in the mid-1970s.

In presenting her analysis of what became known as the Team B exercise, Anne Cahn uses her extensive experience in international affairs, a careful review of many previously unavailable documents, and interviews with key individuals involved in the affair. (I should disclose that I worked with the author at the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the Committee on National Security, and reviewed drafts of some chapters of her book.)

Shortly after Gerald Ford succeeded Richard Nixon, the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) began to push for an alternative review of Soviet strategic capabilities, contending that the National Intelligence Estimates prepared by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) might be understating Soviet strategic strength. Competent analysts, however, had criticized the CIA's reports as greatly **overstating** Soviet military expenditures. **[WhereIsFiber's note: The Soviets, now the Russians, have always spent a small fraction on defense compared to our wildly wasteful U.S. ""Defense"" budgets. The USA spends on ""Defense"" what the next 12 countries combined spend on defense. That's why our economy is just limping along and our national debt has skyrocketed to 19 Trillion, and dangerously rising.]**

In late 1975, then-CIA Director William Colby responded negatively to the PFIAB proposal and disagreed with its contention that the agency's intelligence estimates erred by ""projecting a sense of complacency."" But President Ford, engaged as he was with Ronald Reagan's challenge for the 1976 Republican presidential nomination, was sensitive to possible fight-wing criticism. He eventually authorized the Team B adventure.

The initial idea was to appoint three panels of outside experts that would assess, respectively, the threat to U.S. ICBM survival created by Soviet missile accuracy, the Soviet anti-submarine warfare capability against U.S. nuclear missile submarines, and the extent to which Soviet air defenses could prevent penetration by strategic bombers.

The navy, however, considered information about the operational aspects of submarine patrols and whether they might be trailed by Soviet assets as information that could not be shared, even with the CIA. The second panel, accordingly, was reoriented to deal with Soviet strategic objectives. It is the work of this panel that is generally referred to as the Team B Report.

Whatever might be said for evaluation of strategic capabilities by a group of outside experts, the impracticality of achieving useful results by ""independent"" analysis of strategic objectives should have been self-evident. Moreover, the futility of the Team B enterprise was assured by the selection of the panel's members. Rather than including a diversity of views, as was recently done in putting together the, so-called Rumsfeld Commission on the ballistic missile threat, the Strategic Objectives Panel was composed entirely of individuals who had made careers of viewing the Soviet menace with alarm.

As the author notes, the panel's chairman, Richard Pipes, has been called the ""intellectual godfather"" of the thesis that the Soviets had rejected nuclear parity and were bent on fighting a nuclear war. **[My note: This is laughable.]** In an interview, Pipes told Cahn that he wrote most of the first section of the report, which criticized the CIA for underestimating the ""intensity, scope, and implicit threat"" posed by the Soviet Union, by using evidence relating to capabilities rather than intentions. This section argued that the really important evidence demonstrated that ""Soviet leaders are first and foremost offensively rather than defensively minded."" **[Note: Haha, if you're going to waste Trillions of U.S. taxpayers' money on ""Defense,"" you need a big boogeyman/bogeyman, a scary ""enemy,"" a phantom menace. The reality is the U.S. foisted the Cold War on the Russians.  The Russians wanted to be our ally, just like the French are our ally.  In fact, the Russians were our allies during World War 2 against the Nazis.  After World War 2, U.S. war mongers started the Cold War against Russia.  No less than double Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling has said the Soviets/Russians did not want the Cold War.]**

It is now entirely clear, however, that by the early 1970s Soviet leaders had concluded that the Soviet Union could not win, and might not even survive, a nuclear war. Anyone thereafter dealing with Soviet officials could readily recognize that they held no illusions about having military superiority over the United States and its allies. They were completely aware that NATO was a security alliance with a solidarity and common purpose that could not be ascribed to the Soviet-dominated Warsaw Pact. Even the dullest of Soviet leaders must have known that a limited nuclear war would almost certainly have meant the destruction of the Kremlin--and thus of the Soviet empire.

Detente was not doing too well when Team B met in 1975. It had been badly damaged by the U.S.-Soviet confrontation precipitated in 1973 by the Israeli-Egyptian war. In October of that year, the encirclement of Egypt's Third Army by Israeli defense forces prompted Leonid Brezhnev to call for joint U.S.-Soviet intervention to stop the fighting. Otherwise, suggested the Soviet premier, the Soviet Union might consider acting alone. In response to this muted threat, the United States called a worldwide alert of both its conventional and nuclear forces.

Although the crisis soon passed, it cast a continuing chill on the dialogue between Washington and Moscow. The Team B Report was a further blow to detente and, as the author observes, it provided ""intellectual fodder"" for the Committee on the Present Danger, which was spearheaded by former Undersecretary of State Eugene Rostow. In its first policy statement, released two days after the 1976 presidential election, the committee stated that ""the principal threat to our nation, to world peace, and to the cause of human freedom is the Soviet drive for dominance based upon an unparalleled military buildup."" **[Lol. You accuse your ""enemy"" of what you, yourself, are most guilty.]** The Soviet Union, the committee concluded, ""has not altered its long-held goal of a world dominated from a single center--Moscow."" **[The jokes keep coming.]**

Not surprisingly, the founding board members of the Committee on the Present Danger included Team B members Richard Pipes, Foy Kohler, Paul Nitze, and William Van Cleave. When Ronald Reagan took office in 1981, Pipes was named the president's special adviser on the Soviet Union and, in a masterpiece of miscasting, Eugene Rostow, the motivating force behind the Committee on the Present Danger, became director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.

Fortunately, Mikhail Gorbachev's rise to power and the rapport he developed with Ronald Reagan, beginning with their first meeting in Geneva in 1985, put an end to superpower confrontation politics and, in a few years, to the Soviet Union itself. In the interest of fairness, I must note that Team B member Paul Nitze played a constructive role in that process as arms control adviser to Secretary of State George Shultz.

Although detente in the long run survived the right-wing attack, **[this book was published in 1998 during Bill Clinton's presidency, so, no, detente did not survive the Bush/Cheney regime and the ""Project For a New American Century,"" the 21st Century's equivalent of the anti-Nixon, anti-detente ""Team B"" liars]** the painful consequences of the Team B affair can still be felt in the diversion of massive funds from genuine human needs to a grossly excessive U.S. military buildup.

""Killing Detente: The Right Attacks the CIA"" author Anne Cahn voices warm appreciation for the legal work that gave her access to previously undisclosed documents through the Freedom of Information Act. But it is the author's thoughtful analysis of these documents and her searching interviews with key players that give Killing Detente its scope and depth.

Previously we knew little about the Team B Strategic Objectives Panel apart from its report. We now know that the way its members were selected and the manner in which it operated virtually preordained its conclusions. Not only is Anne Cahn's book of historical interest and useful as a teaching tool, but it is also a valuable study of how not to set defense policy.

How legit is the criticism that many current successful businessmen and investors inherited their wealth and/or company or came from educated upper middle class backgrounds? Does it ignore how difficult running a business and investing is (despite criticisms from leftists and the general populace)?,"These two posts should explain much of what I have to say.

Be sure to read the above links (at least read the first one!) before reading the rest of my post.

Growing up I always seen criticism from many leftists- in particular American liberals, Communists (especially those from Russia or descending from former upperclass Soviets),  Anarchists,  and other political groups leaning towards lefty fiscal economics about how its unfair businessmen like Trump are successful because they already inherited the wealth and profitable company of their parents or they came from upper middle class background and have outstanding education like Bill Gates.

This criticism goes beyond people involved in politics. I cannot tell you how many poor people often scoff at the rich business owners because they are just lucky to have been born from wealthy parents. Hell I even see middle class people who are well off attacking the Bill Gates and other successes as lazy imbeciles who are just ""sitting on their butts all day long"" and they are hoarding wealth so it should be distributed.  I seen from the general populace, both poor and middle class, attack the capitalist system because business men aren't really doing hardwork nor are they producing anything of value.

I will admit just for the sake of what I will say in a minute that I am not a conservative. I've been raised in a minarchist household that favors neither leftist nor rightest view but merely view government should have minimal interaction in everything from what movies you watch to visiting a brothel to AK47 owndership. So yes I already have views that are contradictory to conservative idealism.

Yet I could never understand the criticism ""business men are lazy because they inherited their richness"" and ""running a business is as easy as 123!"". Even before I started going into the stock market, I already had first hand experience of how running a business would be like via stays at my auntie (who I mentioned in one of the above reddit links, owns a restaurant). In addition to seeing the dangers and difficulties of kitchen cookings, everytime I stayed over I would always hear her at night getting enraged as she spoke on the phone as she was speaking with employees, partners, and other business associates about so many complex subjects such as paying the bills, trying to get a new insurance company's support, difficulties with kitchen equipment, etc. I could always see how stressed my auntie would be everytime she woke up before she drank coffee and took a bath.

Mind you my auntie is actually quite a successful business owner. At the time she already had a $1,000,000 (I was 14 when she had that amount) in one of her bank accounts and when I talked to her which was weeks before I tried to get into stocks and bonds recently, she told me she had amassed a little over $10 million in that specific bank account. This is not counting assets, her other bank account savings, etc. But I can see despite being merely 46, she's already full of gray hair (I'm only 22 just to put this into perspective).

So I was not naive to believe I'll get rich quick when I tried to enter stock market recently as I already know first hand how hard business can be. Yet even I was caught off guard at how simplistic stuff such as comparing different stocks in chart analysis could be.

So it makes me wonder why the politically left and anarchist as well as poor and many middle class people think running a business and investments is a cakewake? And why many of them think just because Trump was given a lot of cash to start business  by his already rich dad that it was easy as playing video games for him to run his enterprises?

I mean has any one seen how Tom Kalinske left his job as CEO of Sega of America with grey hair just because the stress of company politics got him? Or how medical analysts are saying Steve Jobs had a relatively young death because of his diseases which they theorized was probably caused by being overworked running Apple?

And I’ve obviously sent this conservative snowflake off by saying just what I said above, because even while writing this, I’ve gotten 6 notifications that she has commented on my comment on Facebook, look I’m not denying that yeah, these radical Muslims need to be dealt with, they’re a MAJOR issue, killing people in the name of their god, just because they don’t agree. I was in the 7th grade when 9/11 happened, I will NEVER forget that, and the fear that that instilled in people. But my point is, people are so eager to HATE anyone who disagrees with them, who just says “hey, you know you’re getting all upset about something that isn’t real?” And they just blindly follow. 
I’m sick of all this hate filled nonsense. Even Fox News, and CNN have been caught in lies... I mean come on!  
Small update since I started writing this a new comment from her:
“I don’t give a flying fuck what they think! Thy shouldn’t be heat and shouldn’t be forcing their women to wear those ugly things and forcing their way on others!” ",1756,23,1732,7.470793774195062,1
Does Trump's budget create a greater deficit than some of the things Hillary or Bernie promised?,"(I read the rules, but I could have easily missed something, so please feel free to remove if it is not allowed.)

Last night, in speaking to my mom, we had our agreements as we often do. She said that Trump was absolutely not suited to be president, but that it was just a better all around choice compared to Hillary, (and even Bernie too! she added), because ""all she wants to do is give, give, give. And we can't afford to do that."" Ironically, in the same conversation, not even a minute before, she complained that Trump's administration was trying to take away certain benefits from veterans (disability and something else?) So she clearly has a lot to gain from ""give, give, give,"" and doesn't seem to realize it.

So help me out, guys! I know I've heard that the military budget expansion is allegedly more than it would have cost to fix healthcare, but I can't find those sources. Who would really cost more?

I do have some questions for her of my own, such as ""Who can't afford it?"" - we know the wealthy companies who recently got huge tax breaks are more than capable of affording it, and even that many are taking the money and laying off workers, of all things (AT&amp;T). And ""wouldn't (she) stand to benefit from that?"" But I have such media overload that I've completely shut down and forgotten how to debate. It seems SO obvious at this point to me (especially since she knows he's awfully disqualified) that I don't even know why we're at odds.

If anyone has a resource for discussing this the right way with a parent who seems like they stand a chance of being moved on the subject, can give me budget comparisons (where the money's better spent, how much money we actually can allocate if we rearrange things, or why other nations budgets would or would NOT work in the US), please discuss below.",Liberal,Chemicalbagel,6,2,2018-01-25,818,"Does Trump's budget create a greater deficit than some of the things Hillary or Bernie promised?

Sometimes to defeat your enemy you must become like your enemy. So there was this video online of Muslims celebrating something on a street in Greece. They get attacked by far right football hooligans and violence breaks out. Anyways I go into the comment section and read this. I decide to pretend to be a far right European nationalist and yeah it was pretty fun. Hopefully it'll open the eyes of the commenter to the fact that no one is free from scapegoating and the modern day right isn't really based off rational ideas or principles as much as it is based off of hate and xenophobia.

Just heard an outrageous defense of the confederate flag...,"I grew up in the south, and I have a fair share of southern pride, though as of late I guess it's more akin to southern shame. Anyway, I was making the argument that the confederate flag is a stain on American history. The flag represents a collection of states who desired to secede from the United States (becoming traitors to America) in an effort to preserve their right to own black people as property. I think it's safe to say that anyone knowledgeable of civil war history would agree that the war was primarily about slavery, plain and simple.

Not surprisingly, the response was a deflection and had nothing to do with my points (""...but but but, what about Hillary?"" basically). The response:

*New York City was named after James Stuart, the Duke of York, who was one of the largest slave traders of all time. Should New York City change its name then?*

This was an attempt to discredit me by trying to make me sound like a hypocrite, in spite of the fact that it was completely irrelevant to the topic at hand. It's just another example of the ever-popular ""whataboutisms"" that the right loves to use. That being said, I tried to research this topic and wasn't able to find much. I did find an article written by thedailycaller (surprise surprise, his argument was parroted from a right-wing extremist website) stating exactly what he did, but very little on the actual history and implications.

A Factual Argument in Favor of Net Neutrality (Arm yourself against corporate tyranny),"*This was a comment I wrote in response to a faulty video supporting the repeal of Title II protections on the Internet* 

I’m not sure I see a very good argument for repealing net neutrality. It doesn’t seem to be hurting anyone except the profits of corporations. 

To everyone asking: “What about before the existence of net neutrality? The internet was still the internet and it functions the same way now as it did in 2014!” 


In 2007, Comcast started interfering with BitTorrent traffic on its network. 

In January of 2008, the [FCC launched an investigation into the treatment of BitTorrent traffic by Comcast](https://www.publicknowledge.org/news-blog/blogs/martins-big-ces-announcement) 

In 2010, Google and Verizon, 2 of the biggest net neutrality opponents ([at the time](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/060215/googles-stance-net-neutrality.asp) ), according to the same link, they won this case and the right to discriminate (reasonably against) some third party applications.

Fast forward to September of the following year where [the Federal Register publishes “Open Internet Rules” - a set of rules created by the FCC to get rid of unreasonable discrimination on the internet](https://www.publicknowledge.org/news-blog/blogs/quick-guide-upcoming-net-neutrality-rules-cha) . 

3 years later, this is the important part, May 13th 2014, the FCC releases a proposal that allows for the infamous [“fast lanes and slow lanes” ](https://www.publicknowledge.org/news-blog/blogs/how-the-fccs-proposed-fast-lanes-would-actually-work) for internet connectivity. 

This is the issue, these fast lanes and slow lanes could reinforce vertical monopolies and ISP could steer their customers away from competitors. 

So, basically, the FCC decides to let the public weigh in on their proposal and oh boy... here are the results from Wikipedia:

“July 15, 2014 – FCC opens up on Public Knowledge for public comments, received 1.1 million comments on the first day. Determined that ""less than 1% of comments were clearly opposed to net neutrality.""

“September 15, 2014 – FCC receives 3.7 million comments in total. “The FCC's server crashes again as millions more people, companies, and advocacy organizations weigh in on the open internet rules.”

“February 26, 2015 – FCC passes the Title II Net Neutrality Rules. “In a 3–2 party-line vote, the FCC passes open internet rules applying to both wired and wireless internet connections grounded in Title II authority.”

So to finally answer the question of: “What about before the existence of net neutrality? The internet was still the internet and it functions the same way now as it did in 2014!”
 
You’re right, the internet was the internet, but eventually companies, in order to maximize profits, started to alter the speeds of competition and other third party applications. Their relationships with lobbyists and government prompted the proposal of “fast lanes and slow lanes” and when the public was asked about the proposal, our response was a resounding “no!”. 

Again, if the ISP didn’t have a history of attempting to throttle our service, we wouldn’t need net neutrality. But sadly they do, and the past speaks for itself.

Fracking waste In the Gulf of Mexico,"Hello all.  First let me say that I’m not 100% sure if this is the appropriate place for this and if not would anyone be so kind as to point me in the right direction?

My father is a captain of a  small charter service that launches in the Gulf of Mexico. Last night I was trying to explain to him what was going on with the (new?) law allowing American business to dump waste from offshore fracking sites into the gulf. 
Something else that’s important to know is my father is very conservative. Fox News runs 24/7 in my parents house. Lately he’s been acting a bit more reasonable (or at least has finally taken time to listen to me). 
Unfortunately I feel I missed my opportunity at the time to really explain this issue to him. I did the best I could but he is demanding more ( credible) sources and a more clear explanation of the (law?)
I’m sure this change is going to adversely affect his livelihood and I was under the impression that the Trump administration was at fault for this. 
My father mentioned something along the lines of “Obama started the Gulf of Mexico dumping/fracking problem” and I didn’t know how to respond. 

So I was hoping someone could help fill me in on the logistics, specifically things like the name of the law, when it was passed and hopefully a counter argument to what my pops hears on the republican media.

How do I even retort some of the insane my mother makes defending the current conservative govt?,"So I come from a very conservative family, the kind that thinks America is currently doing great and headed in a wonderful direction because rebublicans are in power. All while not really seeming to know what's going on. They only get news from conservative news sources and literally think there is nothing worse than a liberal. I was having a political conversation with my mother yesterday and here is a sample of some of the things I said:

When I told her the tax cuts aren't for her (she's middle class) but really only for the rich, she responded ""well if I were rich I would want a tax cut too, plus trickle down""... It's hard to even respond, because she isn't rich so she's voting against her own interests and doesn't care. As long as the liberals aren't in power this is OK I guess? I've tried to explain that the economy benefits when people at the bottom are given access to more money because they actually spend it instead of banking it, too which she replies ""rich people worked hard for thier money and deserve to keep it"", sidestepping the argument. 

Shes clearly bought into the anti-science, because she says ""science can't really prove anything for certain anyways"" so therefore doesn't believe in climate change or that vaccines don't cause autism (just 2 examples)... If there is 1 study that says the opposite of the facts, then ""we don't know for sure""

She says liberals are just atheists and want to take God away from our country. I respomd to this by saying liberals only want to take God out of politics, and I get the classic ""we are a Christian nation and our founding fathers were Christians"" BS.

She doesn't want socialized Healthcare and doesn't want to raise the minimum wage because ""those people don't work hard enough and don't deserve it"" despite the fact that both would greatly benefit the country as a whole.

Is it a lost cause, Im thinking it is. It just kills me inside that my own family has such little regard for what is real and true, and shows no concern for thier own interests as long as the liberals, whose policy would be in thier interests, aren't in power.

She has also blamed me being liberal on the fact that I went to college, as if my learning to think critically made me a worse person.

"My best friend has been indoctrinated, right-wing extremism leaks into universities","(Sorry for the clickbait title, the post is much more boring) If you are interested in what 17 to 18 year olds talk about at universities in the US, read ahead. 

Hello, for some context I am a freshman student at university as is my friend that is the subject of this post. My friend, however, will not be the primary subject of this post, rather it will be about a discussion we had in the past week. We talked about many issues in Europe, namely, the presence of multiculturalism, multiculturalism in general and the migrant crisis as well how we feel personally about the issues at hand. Being only a college freshman, I'm not very good at writing. Also, I very rarely think about political issues, so correct me if you see some errors in my thinking.


The discussion was rather long and drawn out, but I will try my best to illustrate several key points visited. First, my friend is vehemently opposed to the idea of multiculturalism. He believes that it is what leads to the decay of society, that multicultural societies are doomed to failure and that Western society should formulate policies that are not multicultural as an act of self-preservation. Additionally, he believes that an ethno-state is not only feasible, but a desirable of goal of Western society as he claims that cultural homogeneity optimizes stability in a society. The West, he argues, adopts multiculturalism at its own peril and is in the beginning stages of its self-authored collapse. As an example of an ethno-state, he cites Japan as a prominent and successful example and that Europe should follow suit.


He justifies these claims in saying that it is only natural for a native people to preserve their resources for their future, and therefore policies that accomplish this aim peacefully, are morally justified. Moreover, it is a nation's sovereign right to conduct their policies without interference. Returning to the idea of an ethno-state and Europe's current migrant crisis, my friend believes that Europe should expel the incoming Muslim population believing that their culture is incompatible and undesirable for the health of Europe. Not only this, he believes that they will never be able to integrate into European culture, it is an impossibility. 




I disagreed with many, if not all of the positions expressed by my friend during our discussion. I also had noticed that there are some fairly obvious contradictions in his arguments. More broadly, there appear to be very glaring contradictions in the sentiments held by those on the far end of the right. 

Below are my responses to my friend. I will number my thoughts below, as this post is longer than I had anticipated.

1. Expulsion of a large collection of people, even if attempted peacefully, will most likely turn violent and will encourage egregious human right's abuses.

2. Expulsion of a group with undesirable characteristics sets a dangerous precedent. Expulsion, even if peaceful, will empower those who would like to expel other groups on the basis of race, socioeconomic status, intelligence, or any discriminating factor really.

3. Western society, as far as I can tell, is characterized by deliberation and resolving on the most ethical choice of action. By assuming an unethical course of action to preserve the ""West"", it becomes fundamentally corrupted.

4. While certain members of the Muslim population may have contemptible views in certain areas, one's views and attitudes are not sufficient grounds for expulsion. Action in violation of the established law, however, is. 

5. Due to the fact that many find the idea of an ethno-state unpalatable, there must exist an equilibrium point at which the presence of other cultures to a degree is optimal and stable from an evolutionary perspective. Theories of altruism and reciprocity can account for these.  

6. Although it may be a nation's sovereign right to exercise expulsion policies, it is not necessarily justified from an ethical standpoint. 

Contradictions and my concerns in his positions and right-wing extremists in general:

1. Fanatic support of freedom of speech, yet will not tolerate those with ""undesirable characteristics"", whose characteristics manifest in the form of cultural practices and other beliefs. Freedom of belief is not protected should extremists assume power. 
(For the record, there is nothing wrong with supporting freedom of speech, this is just an interesting contradiction I have noticed)

2. Fear of an alien population entering their political climate and enacting laws that are more oriented towards Islamism. However, a fear of right-wing extremists enacting policies directed towards expelling those with ""undesirable characteristics"" elicits little, if any fear despite the seriousness such a precedent represents. Islamism and and these extremists are anti-democratic, but fear is not expressed equally. 



Most of these views held by my friend are most likely derived from websites like Youtube, 4Chan, and other media sources. While I personally believe these websites should not censor extremist views for freedom of speech reasons, we should not underestimate the power these websites can potentially hold over our youth. We can't ban these views, however, we can debate them and see how internet media can effectively indoctrinate American youth. I am sure most people here are aware of this, but it needs to be said, and then said again.

Fox News cost him his marriage. I just have to share this story.,"I live in a red state.  Being a liberal is akin to being a mental patient in this place.  But we deal with it.

So here's my story.  I am trying to get into the dating world a year after losing my wife.  I get on Match.com, and as you might imagine, virtually every woman lists her political leanings as conservative.

Last night I started getting messages from a woman I hadn't noticed yet.  Part of what she liked about me was my political views.

She was married for 24 years.  She loved being married, and her husband was a good guy.  He didn't give a damn about politics.

Then we elected a black president, and he lost his shit.  Suddenly politics are all he thinks about.  He started stockpiling provisions for the coming apocalypse.  He couldn't understand how his wife didn't see that the world was coming to an end.  It took a toll on their marriage, and they divorced a few years ago.

Mass Shootings and The Media Study,"Hello,

I’m a Master's student at Penn State University conducting a study into how media coverage of mass shootings impacts how we perceive them.

This study is entirely non-partisan, which is why I'm hoping to get responses from people from across the political spectrum. However, political affiliation is not a measure in this study. Also, I'm not receiving any grant money or any other compensation from this and I'm conducting it independently from any outside groups. This is simply a research study for a class.

The time to complete the 8-question survey is about one minute, so if you have a moment to spare, I would appreciate it immensely.

My Letter to Jeff Denham about net neutrality,"Rep. Denham, 

It’s not that I don’t know you’re a corporate puppet who will do whatever your wealthy donors want you to do, but for better or worse you are our “elected” official, so I won’t let that stop me from voicing my concerns anyway.  Even if I don’t believe it will do any good…

But regardless, the reason I’m writing is to voice my concern about the upcoming battle for net neutrality.  Ajit Pai (one of Trump’s hand-picked sycophants at the FCC) has made the claim that the regulations that stop corporations like Comcast, Verizon, Time Warner, and AT&amp;T from throttling internet speeds for websites they don’t like, or those they want to extort more money from, somehow stifle innovation.   This outrageous statement is just flat out absurd, and I think even those of you who have sold yourself to the highest bidder know that.  Free access to the information that the internet provides is what fuels innovation.  

What *actually* stifles innovation is our elected officials handing over control of the internet to a few corporate juggernauts.  What will hinder innovation, is not having free access to information as we have since the internet made its debut in the world.  What will hinder innovation, is a corporate giant like Comcast deciding it wants to block our access to websites that refuse to pay them a fee every month.  Claiming that removing regulations that were put in place to stop them from doing so will somehow promote innovation is, as I said, absurd.  

It’s not that I think writing a letter, begging you to stand up for net neutrality will do any good, because I know it won’t.  You’ll just ignore the voice of your constituents as you have since you were first elected.  No…  I’m writing in hopes that this will, at the very least,  remind you that you don’t serve whatever “donations” you receive from your corporate donors, but that you actually serve us… The American people and those of us in California.  You are where you are today by the grace of those who voted for you, so when you go to cast your vote on a decision that could potentially destroy a tool that has become an integral part of all of our lives (including yours), think ahead to the next election, and decide if the voters will forgive you for making the incorrect choice.  Think about the outcome of the election should those internet giants suddenly decide to stifle your voice. Then just vote accordingly.  This decision will affect you just as much as it affects the rest of us.

Trump lies are so frequent and counterfactual that the opposite meaning of statements seem more truthful,"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/

Donald Trump's file

Of all Trump's statements that Politifact has checked, a whopping but not surprising 48% are either false or ""pants on fire"" (which indicates ridiculous lies). And another 21% are mostly false. This is a total 48% +21% = 69% of his statements have little or no bearing to truth. Of course, this is only a selected sample of his statements that get fact-checked. 

Politico analyzed then-candidate Trump's 5-hour remark and concluded that Trump lies once every 3 minutes on average, while then-candidate ""Crooked"" Hillary Clinton averaged one lie every 12 minutes.

https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/2016-hillary-clinton-fact-check-week-214286


Just read Trump's latest statement: 

the GOP tax bill ""is going to cost me a fortune, this thing -- believe me. Believe me, this is not good for me.""

The ruling, according to Politico, is....

&gt;While there is uncertainty about the exact scale of Trump’s potential gains -- both because of the lack of a final version of the bill and because of big gaps in the public knowledge about his personal finances -- either of the GOP bills would almost certainly give Trump a big windfall.

&gt;Two independent analyses suggest that it could be in the low tens of millions of dollars immediately. His family also could get as much as $1.1 billion over the longer term if the estate tax is fully repealed, as the House bill would do.

Politico analyzed then-candidate Trump's 5-hour remark and concluded that Trump lies once every 3 minutes on average, while then-candidate ""Crooked"" Hillary Clinton averaged one lie every 12 minutes.

Just read Trump's latest statement: 

the GOP tax bill ""is going to cost me a fortune, this thing -- believe me. Believe me, this is not good for me.""

The ruling, according to Politico, is....

&gt;While there is uncertainty about the exact scale of Trump’s potential gains -- both because of the lack of a final version of the bill and because of big gaps in the public knowledge about his personal finances -- either of the GOP bills would almost certainly give Trump a big windfall.

&gt;Two independent analyses suggest that it could be in the low tens of millions of dollars immediately. His family also could get as much as $1.1 billion over the longer term if the estate tax is fully repealed, as the House bill would do.

I wish this were true, but it's not. Traditionalists want what works, progressives want what makes them feel good.
If it were true, then traditionalists would be able to have discussions with progressives showing them how the results of their ideas are failing and actually debate them on those points. But, again, progressives don't care about results, they care about the feel goods they get from implementing them and there is no possible debate because they are incompatible measurements.
But traditionalists tend to be more risk averse when it comes to jumping on the latest thing that seems to work

and that they tend to think non-traditionalists are short sighted and rash when it comes to the same thing.
Because, well, they are, and demonstrably so. For example, let's look at several European countries pushing for female quotas in board rooms. This has been pushed by Norway first, where the results showed that it was detrimental to the businesses which were forced to do so.
But what do the progressives do? They demand it in more countries because ""doing the right thing"" is more important than ""getting the right results"". Again, progressives think intent is more important than results.
For example, progressives think that many traditions (including religion) no longer ""work"" because they are maladapted to modern needs.
Dude, I'm an atheist who will tell you that a secular society is a horrible thing. I don't believe in religion, but I do believe in what it does for a society. It's damn important.
Of course, traditionalists can see the same data and instead conclude that modern ailments are instead caused by a break down in traditions that progressives are blaming.

Relatively often (typically whenever some new bill or anything is passed), he, some other friends, and myself talk it over and see what everyone thinks. We all come from various backgrounds with varying political views.

My friend is staunchly conservative. Which is fine. He's entitled to have those views and beliefs. However, it's his presentation of these beliefs I have issue with.

"Reagan's Speech on Trade Protectionism (My, How Times Change)","Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp1T7kPEdDY) for the video.

""Here in America, as we reflect on the many things we have to be grateful for, we should take a moment to recognize that one of the key factors behind our nation's great prosperity is the open trade policy that allows the American people to freely exchange goods and services with free people around the world. The freedom to trade is not a new issue for America. **In 1776 our Founding Fathers signed the Declaration of Independence, charging the British with a number of offenses, among them, and I quote, 'cutting off our trade with all parts of the world,'** end quote.

And that same year, a Scottish economist named Adam Smith launched another revolution with a book entitled 'The Wealth of Nations,' which **exposed for all time the folly of protectionism. Over the past 200 years, not only has the argument against tariffs and trade barriers won nearly universal agreement among economists but it has also proven itself in the real world**, where we have seen free-trading nations prosper while protectionist countries fall behind....

Ever since that time, the American people have stayed true to our heritage by rejecting the siren song of protectionism. **In recent years, the trade deficit led some misguided politicians to call for protectionism, warning that otherwise we would lose jobs. But they were wrong again.** In fact, the United States not only didn't lose jobs, we created more jobs than all the countries of Western Europe, Canada, and Japan combined.

Part of the difficulty in accepting the good news about trade is in our words. **We too often talk about trade while using the vocabulary of war. In war, for one side to win, the other must lose. But commerce is not warfare.** Trade is an economic alliance that benefits both countries. There are no losers, only winners. And trade helps strengthen the free world.

Yet **today protectionism is being used by some American politicians as a cheap form of nationalism**, a fig leaf for those unwilling to maintain America's military strength and who lack the resolve to stand up to real enemies—countries that would use violence against us or our allies. Our peaceful trading partners are not our enemies; they are our allies. **We should beware of the demagogs who are ready to declare a trade war against our friends—weakening our economy, our national security, and the entire free world—all while cynically waving the American flag.** The expansion of the international economy is not a foreign invasion; it is an American triumph, one we worked hard to achieve, and something central to our vision of a peaceful and prosperous world of freedom....""

Our peaceful trading partners are not our enemies; they are our allies. **We should beware of the demagogs who are ready to declare a trade war against our friends—weakening our economy, our national security, and the entire free world—all while cynically waving the American flag.** The expansion of the international economy is not a foreign invasion; it is an American triumph, one we worked hard to achieve, and something central to our vision of a peaceful and prosperous world of freedom....""

Research on Religious Fundamentalism Provides one Explanation for Enduring Trump Support,"The psychologist Bob Altemeyer's book [""The Authoritarians""](http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~altemey/) contains research on people who have, through a scored questionnaire, been defined as ""rightwing authoritarians"". In other words they scored very highly on a test of authoritarian attitudes, psychological dispositions, and beliefs.

Research has found, incidentally, that ""rightwing authoritarianism""  (RWA) correlates very highly with religious fundamentalism (in all religions). So he devotes a chapter to talk about research on fundamentalist evangelical Christians. This excerpt is from near the end of that chapter. (bolding mine)

After talking about studies and surveys showing Christian religious fundamentalists were largely ignorant of the Bible and hadn't read most of it...

&gt; Isn’t there something profoundly strange about the fact that so many fundamentalists have apparently skipped over so much of the Bible? Wouldn’t you read the Bible, cover to cover, over and over, until the end of your days, if you really thought this was the revealed word of God? Let’s remember who that is: GOD, damn it all, the almighty, eternal, omnipresent--not to mention all-knowing--creator of the universe. What else could you read that would be as important as God’s message, if you believed that’s what the Bible is? What could be one-zillionth as important? What on earth is going on? **Don’t the fundamentalists themselves believe what they preach to everyone else?**

&gt; Maybe not. When I cover the topic of hypnosis in my introductory psychology course I often describe a series of experiments done with the “Hidden Observer” technique. In a typical study people are hypnotized and then they put their arm in some ice-water. The hypnotist tells them their arm feels fine, and they obligingly report it feels just peachy. But then the hypnotist appeals to a “Hidden Observer” he says is inside the person. If this observer knows that actually the arm is hurting like all blazes, it’s to make a certain sign confirming that. A lot of Hidden Observers spill the beans and admit the arm truly does hurt, even though the “public” subject still insists it does not.

&gt; I have then, at a later date, asked my students to let their ""Hidden Observers"" answer a question about the existence of God. “Does this person (that is, you) have doubts that (s)he was created by an Almighty God who will judge each person and take some into heaven for eternity while casting others into hell forever?” **A third of the high RWA students** checked off an alternative that read, “Yes, (s)he has secret doubts which (s)he has kept strictly to herself/himself that this is really true.” **Another twenty percent** said they had such doubts, but at least one other person knew about them. **That adds up to most of the highly authoritarian students.**

&gt; I don’t think I was actually communicating with tiny Munchkins inside the students’ heads. I suspect the Hidden Observer angle just gives people a chance to admit something without taking full responsibility for admitting it--sort of like, “The devil made me do it.” But I think we see in these numbers a continuing subterranean after-shock from that one-sided search about the existence of God that (we saw in Chapter 3) high RWAs typically engage in. The “search” was so one-sided it didn’t really resolve the question to the searcher’s satisfaction, all verbal assertions notwithstanding. The doubts remain, but are enormously covered up.

&gt; This means the whole edifice of belief, Bible and bustle is built on an unresolved fundamental issue in many fundamentalists. Indeed, it’s **the** fundamental issue, isn’t it? But what speaks loudest to me is how secret these doubts are in so many cases. NO ONE knows, for very good reason, and the secret doubters will probably never “come out” of the choir. Instead their faithful presence in church will reassure all the others, including the other secret doubters, that “everyone in our group really believes this.” And they may well carry their secret to the grave.

&gt; ...I want to emphasize also that all of the above is based on studies in which, if the opposite were true instead, that would have been shown. This is not just “somebody’s opinion.” It’s what the fundamentalists themselves said and did. And it adds up to a truly depressing bottom line...

****

The point (and you will see this clearly if you read the rest of the chapter and the book), is that religious fundamentalism, like authoritarianism in general, is **highly social**. Authoritarians value their social ingroup more highly than anything else, and they correspondingly value loyalty to it and submission to its authorities. They are extremely compartmentalized in their beliefs and principles - n fact they are largely *unprincipled* - [allowing them to always side with their ingroup without feeling cognitive dissonance](https://pics.me.me/support-for-u-s-airstrikes-in-syria-100-democrats-republicans-80-19662980.png) (these findings are talked about in other chapters).

Most conservative Americans live in very conservative areas, and areas that are very homogeneous in other ways (compared to moderate, liberal, libertarian, and far-left Americans). They also, more so than other political groups, value their membership in their ingroup. It's no coincidence that in America today, ""nationalists"" are so crazy, so dogmatic, so resistant to facts and reality, so stubborn in the face of all evidence, and so loyal despite being so clearly swindled by those they are loyal to. For nationalists, practically by definition, **identity is more important than truth.**

**The silver lining is, we can reasonably infer that many of the people who are the loudest supporters of Trump, and the loudest and most stubborn supporters of the nationalist movement in general, are in fact highly doubtful of their own position. In fact, it is probably precisely because they are secretly doubtful that they are outwardly so pugnacious, loyal, and dogmatic.**

****

(If you are wondering if the same is true of liberals or leftwingers or libertarians, or whatever, you can read the rest of the book to find the answer. The TLDR is no, they are not. People who score low on the RWA scale are actually very psychologically different - they are not as compartmentalized and inconsistent in their beliefs, they are more eager to criticize their own ""side"", they are more intellectually honest with themselves, and they are overall more rational in the way they approach many problems, *especially ones relate to group-membership*, as this is precisely the area where high-RWAs, who are practically defined by an ""us vs them"" outlook, get crazy. Of course this brings it's own problems, for example, a tendency toward infighting and petty sectarianism...)",Liberal,nationalistsareRINOs,0,7,2017-09-09,956,"Research on Religious Fundamentalism Provides one Explanation for Enduring Trump Support The psychologist Bob Altemeyer's book [""The Authoritarians""](http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~altemey/) contains research on people who have, through a scored questionnaire, been defined as ""rightwing authoritarians"".

They are extremely compartmentalized in their beliefs and principles - n fact they are largely *unprincipled* - [allowing them to always side with their ingroup without feeling cognitive dissonance](https://pics.me.me/support-for-u-s-airstrikes-in-syria-100-democrats-republicans-80-19662980.png) (these findings are talked about in other chapters).

Most conservative Americans live in very conservative areas, and areas that are very homogeneous in other ways (compared to moderate, liberal, libertarian, and far-left Americans). They also, more so than other political groups, value their membership in their ingroup. It's no coincidence that in America today, ""nationalists"" are so crazy, so dogmatic, so resistant to facts and reality, so stubborn in the face of all evidence, and so loyal despite being so clearly swindled by those they are loyal to. For nationalists, practically by definition, **identity is more important than truth.**

**The silver lining is, we can reasonably infer that many of the people who are the loudest supporters of Trump, and the loudest and most stubborn supporters of the nationalist movement in general, are in fact highly doubtful of their own position. In fact, it is probably precisely because they are secretly doubtful that they are outwardly so pugnacious, loyal, and dogmatic.**

****

(If you are wondering if the same is true of liberals or leftwingers or libertarians, or whatever, you can read the rest of the book to find the answer. The TLDR is no, they are not. People who score low on the RWA scale are actually very psychologically different - they are not as compartmentalized and inconsistent in their beliefs, they are more eager to criticize their own ""side"", they are more intellectually honest with themselves, and they are overall more rational in the way they approach many problems, *especially ones relate to group-membership*, as this is precisely the area where high-RWAs, who are practically defined by an ""us vs them"" outlook, get crazy. Of course this brings it's own problems, for example, a tendency toward infighting and petty sectarianism...)",6909,88,6820,8.840580188488795,1

Late Night Comedies,"I've been thinking about the liberal late night comedies. Daily Show, Full Frontal, Last Week, and now Jordan Klepper. And talk shows, too. Colbert, Myers, Fallon, Ferguson, and Kimmel are all liberal. The talk shows probably have a fairly diverse audience, except for Colbert. But the comedies, I would be willing to bet, have an almost exclusively liberal audience. The problem is that these people try to educate their audiences on the liberal perspective, but they're preaching to the choir. Jon Oliver certainly exposes some larger, interesting stories that I'm sure few people are aware of. And Samantha Bee clearly has a feminist slant that others do not. So audiences are still learning from these shows, but they're not changing any minds. Jordan Klepper is going to be the same thing. He's making a liberal parody show that lampoons conservative hosts. For one, I'm not sure how all of these shows can survive aiming at the same demographic, but more importantly, their not drawing in anyone new.

Given the amount of studies I don't think anyone can claim men and women have different innate interests. I don't think it should be controversial to say that, but I can understand why it is.

Current females working in tech probably feel attacked when it's said that women may just have different interests and aren't as good as men in certain things. I can understand how demoralizing it is to hear some thing like that.

A criticism I had of the document was how much it focused on conservatism. It advocated rethinking normal diversity which made sense, but then advocates ideological diversity claiming conservatives can offer a lot to the company. This makes zero sense to me. He's just rehashing the same argument to increase minority representation to increase conservative representation.

It's not liberal's fault that conservatives are [underrepresented in STEM fields](http://www.nature.com/polopoly_fs/7.39963.1476802115!/image/nature_news_US-political-views_20.10.2016_WEB2.png_gen/derivatives/landscape_630/nature_news_US-political-views_20.10.2016_WEB2.png). Every study has shown that conservatives just like women have different interests. It might be due to religion, culture, or whatever but conservatives just aren't interested in fields regarding Science, Technology, Engineering, or Math.

When conservatives are so eager to discuss biological differences as to why Women aren't interested in STEM, they should be just as interested in discussing why their own aren't interested in STEM either.

Black Americans are being terrorized by hate groups, and then concerns being absolutely ignored by political institutions.  That is abhorrent, reprehensible.

No, no, my fellow liberals, he terrorized us but he needs compassion.  He clearly needs help.  There is no amount of violence which will undo pain.  There is only forgiveness and redemption for him.

And on a broader level, I've been thinking a lot about whether it really pays to be polite. Tolerant. Hoping that unemotional, straightforward presentation of facts will sway people's minds.

And reckless power, hatred, and INtolerance got an awful human being elected as the President. It worked.

ITT a reformed authoritarian cultist explains how Trump manipulates people and takes the communities questions.,"Greetings r/Liberal. My name is Prester Jane and I am a reformed extremist. I was raised in a hardcore authoritarian cult (I didn't even have a Social Security Number until I was 14) that had its own school and was subjected to considerable mental conditioning and ritual abuse. In my teen years I rebelled against the cult and left it- only to spend the next 15 years joining one cult after another. Eventually I hit rock bottom (which for me was homelessness) and admitted that the problem was me. I got myself some help (thank god for the *Haven for Hope* in San Antonio, Texas) and was able to be successfully deprogrammed. I have been in recovery for five years now.

I have spent the past several years writing a detailed psychological framework that explains how authoritarians think and function with an aim to demystify and humanize authoritarians. I call this the ""Narrativist Framework"". I am currently in the process of putting the Narrativist Framework into a publicly viewable format (it has been primarily developed with the support of a small community on a paywalled forum) in order to do my bit in the resistance.

While I am not an academic a fair number of academics have reviewed/supported my work during its development.

In point of fact at present it is possible to watch many of the concepts in the Narrativist Framework demonstrate themselves in real time among Trump supporters.

As you can imagine, there is no TLDR for such material- authoritarians are fundamentally processing reality in a very different manner than you and I and understanding an authoritarian means understanding the different way they are experiencing the exact same events.

I will be monitoring this thread and will be more than happy to answer any questions about the Narrativist Framework.

How feasible would it be to have a ... confederation of states band together to form a universal healthcare system?,"First, I need a better name, but I do not know if one exists.  A confederation suggests a voluntary coming together compared to something like a federation where it's not voluntary.  But the word confederation is tarnished, and federation is not (like federation of planets from star trek).

Titles aside, what if we went beyond just lone states enacting universal healthcare models?  I'd prefer we did this on a national level, but if that takes longer than we liberals would like, could we do it with multiple states?

Vermont was too small, California might be able to make a go of it due to its size... but would it not be easier to collectively bargain for drug prices if ALL the liberal states banded together and created universal healthcare models?  If they tried to align their legislatures to have uniform standards (what our broken federal congress is supposed to do) would that be unconstitutional because only the federal government is allowed to control interstate commerce?  Or would offering healthcare with a common standard not interfere with that?

I am imagining that if say 10 liberal states aligned their laws and enacted a universal healthcare model, residents of each state would be able to get care in other member states.  We'd have to get some control from the federal government to allow the repurposing of medicare funds and other federal expenditures towards the state run universal healthcare model... but would that not be a worthwhile project?

Amending the constitution to set up a republic with equal and proportional representation in the Legislative and Executive branches.,"Note- I still need the judicial branch, and appreciate constructive criticism.

Legislative Elections:
We should make it so all 100 senate seats and 435 voting house seats (I think) are voted every 4 years, but shifted to the middle of the President's term, making this a congressional midterm election.

This could also include the 6 non-voting house members.

Every party that would like to run in in the congressional midterm election would have to present 100 people eligible to run for the senate, and 435 eligible for the house, listed in order from either 1-100 or 1-435(which will be discussed later). If this is not done they will not be on the ballot. The vote will now take place, with the people voting on the party they want, with all parties that met the requirements being on the national ballot, listed in order of national party membership from highest to lowest.

The percentages are taken for the house and senate vote, and each party is given representation in each respective house of congress according to that percentage, rounding to the nearest whole number.

So if Party A won 21.7% of the senate vote, they would receive 22 senate seats. They would go down that list, picking their highest 22 nominees.

The lists they created would be in order of those they would like to see be a congressperson most (1), to those they would like to be a congressperson least (100 or 435). They can appoint older congresspeople to serve multiple terms (unless term limits are instated, in which case they should follow them), and how each party chooses their nominees is up to them.

I also propose that if this is instated, we make private funding for campaigns and parties beyond a grassroots level illegal, and have everything else judged and funded by the government.

Presidential elections:
The President/Vice President is a lot simpler.

You just lump the top 20 candidates and their running mates together on the ballot (if 20 candidates aren't 'available', however many there are), and have two rounds of voting.

If in the first round of the presidential election, someone holds a plurality, they immediately become the President-Elect, and their running mate the Vice-President elect.

If a plurality isn't secured, the voting will move on to a second round, where only the two nominees, and their running mates, that have the highest percentage of the vote go on.

The second round will take place, with only the two candidates. Whoever receives the largest number of votes goes on to be the President-Elect, and their running mate the Vice President-Elect.",Liberal,but_im_a_horse,0,0,2017-06-24,1033,"Amending the constitution to set up a republic with equal and proportional representation in the Legislative and Executive branches.

Legislative Elections:
We should make it so all 100 senate seats and 435 voting house seats (I think) are voted every 4 years, but shifted to the middle of the President's term, making this a congressional midterm election.

This could also include the 6 non-voting house members.

Every party that would like to run in in the congressional midterm election would have to present 100 people eligible to run for the senate, and 435 eligible for the house, listed in order from either 1-100 or 1-435(which will be discussed later).

Some neverTrump conservative views on the healthcare bill,"These are some posts of conservative thoughts on the trumpcare bill on reddit thread from their sub:

&gt;The TrumpCare bill is still largely based on left-wing economics. That's why the Tea Partiers oppose it.

&gt;Ivanka's maternity care proposals are liberal to the core. You want to take care of people, leave it in the people's hands. They can handle it just fine.

&gt;The wall is big government because we're paying for it.

&gt;Trade wars, protectionism, and government picking winners and losers (through his incentives like the Carrier deal) is not conservative.

&gt;It's all a weird mash-up with Trump. The only thoroughly conservative thing he's done of any consequence is Gorsuch.

&gt;The American sick will be fine, by the way. I have faith in the potential of the American wallet to take care of its own. Democrats do not, because it makes them vestigial.

&gt;Gutting healthcare is arguably not happening, based on tthe bill going through congress right now. Also the funding for PP is intact. And the above poster said apart from the wall.

&gt;Inconsistency, hypocrisy, and lying; then. ""Trumpism"" might be as simple as conservatives being known for flip-flopping based on convenience. That's certainly been the impression the GOP has generated with Obamacare and the Comey hearings.

&gt;There's also the lack of values that Trump has become identified with. Conservatives are now largely seen as being xenophobic and sexist. Of course, we were always accused of this, but after Trump its going to be a lot harder to make the case for that.

&gt;I was going to say ""hate the liberals and their media"", but even that doesn't work, because Trump is engaging in a number of policies and stances that are quite liberal.

"Going to dinner tonight (in approx. 6 hours) with my super conservative grandparents. They love to talk about how great Trump is, and how much they hated Obama. Looking for arguments or topics to shut them the hell up.","**TL;DR:** My grandpa is pretty well educated and he went to a super liberal university, but for some reason, he's a staunch Republican. Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, MAGA hat, the works. Every weekend we go out for dinner (we alternate who pay's the bill, and he tips like 10%, by the way, lol) and he starts dropping ridiculous claims, and headlines he no doubt found from Breitbart or something. And we argue about his claims (For you debaters it's a SPAR format we don't come in spewing sources like in Policy). Last week I managed to shut him up with Net Neutrality. But for the most, part I don't normally come prepared. But this time I'm hoping to come in guns loaded.

-------------------------------------------------------------

My grandpa is the biggest culprit (my grandma kind of just sits there and cheers my grandpa on). He grew up on a farm in the midwest with like two dozen siblings. He went to UCLA where he got his Masters in Mechanical Engineering and an MBA. Then he worked for Lockheed Martin for most of his life. Last weekend we went out to dinner and he was telling me about how NOAA fabricated climate studies by altering temperature readings. He went on to talk about how most climate studies fudge their ""other"" variables toward the back and don't publish their Standard Deviations cause they're so substantial.

I all but lost it.

&gt;What studies are you talking about!?! There are literally thousands of studies from several thousands of credible institutions and journals that publish their methods and their SD.

&gt;How do you explain ice caps melting?

&gt;You wanna talk about fabrication and lies? Let's talk about a president that won't show people his tax returns, who is currently under investigation for corruption after firing the man investigating him, who tells us the unemployment rate is +40%, who privately runs his companies.

And then we debate the topics back and forth for the duration of the dinner.

I'm just so baffled that my grandpa can be so educated (in natural sciences nonetheless), yet so narrowminded. He loves his Fox News and his Rush Limbaugh.

BUTTT he also loves his computers so I finally got him to shut up, I asked

&gt;Well how do you feel about Net Neutrality

And he started getting quiet and replied

&gt;I think the Net is already Neutral, I don't see what the big deal is

And I knew I had him on something.

&gt;You realize the FCC is pushing measures to end net neutrality. They're ignoring hundreds of thousands of comments and testimony in opposition to their efforts. And doing so benefits no one, it only benefits like 4 massive companies.

And then he said

&gt;I'll be honest I don't know much about Net Neutrality.

THEN BOOM

&gt;They want to start metering your internet, just like you pay per kilowatt hour for electricity, the government wants you to pay per kilobyte of internet activity. They want to give companies the right to sell your personalized data. They want to privatize the internet.

And he said

&gt;Well I don't like that at all I better do some research on Net Neutrality when I get home.

That was the first time in the history of talking to him that I have ever shut him up.

I would like very much to recreate that.

Exxon owns the country of Chad,"Pop quiz. Do you know what country exports the most refined petroleum of any country in the world? Take a guess. The US? Nope, we're 5th. Russia? Nope, 2nd. 

Did you guess the Netherlands? Because surprisingly that is the actual answer: 

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_refined_petroleum_exports

Second question, what country gets the largest portion of Russia's exports? Take a guess. China? Nope. Iran? Try again. 

Again, very surprisingly (at least to me), it's the Netherlands, and it's all oil that needs refining: 

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_Russia

So maybe the Russia/EU rivalry is not quite as hot as it seems going by the MSM? Maybe it is a bit for show and the two are quite dependent on each other? 

However, The Netherlands is smart enough to diversify their income streams. Their economy is not too dependent on the single export of refined petroleum. 

Here's a treemap showing all their exports proportionally: 

* https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/2014_Netherlands_Products_Export_Treemap.png

As you can see, it's pretty diversified. However, you know what country _isn't_ diversified? Chad. Let's look at Chad. 

Here's the same treemap of Chad's exports: 

* https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Tree_map_export_2009_Chad.jpeg

Looks a bit different, doesn't it? Eggs in one basket much? So the price of unrefined oil essentially determines Chad's GDP for that year. Great. 

Now, guess who owns the equipment to do all this oil extraction? If you read the title, I'm hoping you're guessing Exxon, and you'd be right. 75% of the infrastructure to extract oil from Chad is owned by Exxon, and the other 25% _was_ owned by Chevron, who sold it to the Chadian Government for $1.3 Billion dollars. In 2014.
 
* https://www.chevron.com/stories/chevron-announces-sale-of-interests-in-chad-and-cameroon

Where did the Government of Chad get the money for that?! Why they got a huge loan, of course. Who did they get a loan from? Why none other than Glencore, the 14th largest company in the world, who also does extraction of oil and coal, as well as copper and zinc and already has some oil operations in southern Chad. What a coincidence. /s

* https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/glencoremapforweb.png?w=1024&amp;h=725

Meanwhile through all of this, the GDP of Chad has increased from $1.3 Billion in 2001 to $11 Billion in 2015. Almost 10x in just 20 years. Pretty good!

Guess what the revenue of Exxon and Glencore was in 2015, for comparison? More or less than Chad? Exxon had revenue of $218 Billion, and Glencore had revenue of $152 Billion. That's the yearly equivalent of 20 Chads and 14 Chads, respectively. 

You've heard of ""company towns"", where the town is basically owned by one company? Well this is a ""company nation"" and it's _far_ from the only one. 

So really what we are seeing in 2014 is Chevron effectively selling their 25% ownership of Chad to Glencore, and doing it through the Chadian government in a way so they're on the hook for over a billion dollars of additional debt. Debt slavery, but on a national scale, to a whole government. They're also contractually required to pay it off in just 4 years! I don't think they're going to make that payment schedule, which would end in 2018. I wonder what Glencore will demand in return for missed payments. What laws they will have the Chadian government make for them, in return for extending their debt deadlines. 

Now on top of all this, in the most recent twist, as of November 2016 the Chadian Government is now **suing Exxon for $74 Billion**. That is 5x the GDP of Chad. 

*  https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/11/16/exxons-74-billion-fine-in-chad-unbelievable-economic-numbers-are-unbelievable/#6ebfd3cd6878

The government are in a sense biting the hand that feeds them, with Exxon being responsible for essentially 75% of Chad's GDP. Exxon is unlikely to pay, because even though their insanely huge profit for 2015 (not revenue, but income profit) was a staggering $16 Billion dollars, that is still dwarfed by a $74 Billion lawsuit. 

Will Chad settle for less than $74 Billion? Is this just a money grab and they won't actually hold Exxon's feet to the fire, and they just want a cut and will settle for a few hundred million? Perhaps. They do have that Glencore debt coming due in 2018, and the lawsuit may be their way to try and get money to pay that debt. A Hail Mary pass for sure. 

If they don't back down and neither does Exxon, will the Chadian government use the military and exile Exxon and take over the equipment when Exxon refuses to pay? Or going even more deeply, is this lawsuit perhaps essentially Glencore kicking out Exxon, to gain control of the Chadian market? It would be great to find information on who funded and created the lawsuit, but it seems this information is hard to come by.  

This is where the story stands for now. I've searched, and there seems to be a moratorium of news about this since the announcement of the lawsuit 6 months ago. The last I saw, Exxon was ""in talks"" with the Government of Chad. We will have to wait and see what happens next, but it's clear there's a strong division forming between Exxon and the Government of Chad, possibly being pushed by Glencore. 

It seems that Chad is merely a plaything in games played by companies that are 10x bigger than countries. Reminds me of the British East India company, and how they essentially owned India for 100 years before the British Government actually stepped in and took ownership. But this is happening in 2017, and it's about oil. 

This is called petro-imperialism. People often think of imperialism in the case of a nation conquering another nation with their army, but it also happens with companies. Companies that are even financially larger than nations, who hire mercenaries to defend their oil equipment and take over governments. 

Ever wonder why they don't teach _this_ in school? ",Liberal,magnora7,1,1,2017-05-09,1079,"Exxon owns the country of Chad Pop quiz. Do you know what country exports the most refined petroleum of any country in the world? Take a guess. The US? Nope, we're 5th. Russia? Nope, 2nd. 

Did you guess the Netherlands? Because surprisingly that is the actual answer: 

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_refined_petroleum_exports

Second question, what country gets the largest portion of Russia's exports? Take a guess. China? Nope. Iran? Try again. 

Again, very surprisingly (at least to me), it's the Netherlands, and it's all oil that needs refining: 

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_Russia

So maybe the Russia/EU rivalry is not quite as hot as it seems going by the MSM? Maybe it is a bit for show and the two are quite dependent on each other? 

However, The Netherlands is smart enough to diversify their income streams. Their economy is not too dependent on the single export of refined petroleum. 

Here's a treemap showing all their exports proportionally: 

* https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/2014_Netherlands_Products_Export_Treemap.png

As you can see, it's pretty diversified. However, you know what country _isn't_ diversified? Chad. Let's look at Chad. 

Here's the same treemap of Chad's exports: 

* https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Tree_map_export_2009_Chad.jpeg

Looks a bit different, doesn't it? Eggs in one basket much? So the price of unrefined oil essentially determines Chad's GDP for that year. Great. 

Now, guess who owns the equipment to do all this oil extraction? If you read the title, I'm hoping you're guessing Exxon, and you'd be right. 75% of the infrastructure to extract oil from Chad is owned by Exxon, and the other 25% _was_ owned by Chevron, who sold it to the Chadian Government for $1.3 Billion dollars. In 2014.
 
* https://www.chevron.com/stories/chevron-announces-sale-of-interests-in-chad-and-cameroon

Where did the Government of Chad get the money for that?! Why they got a huge loan, of course. Who did they get a loan from? Why none other than Glencore, the 14th largest company in the world, who also does extraction of oil and coal, as well as copper and zinc and already has some oil operations in southern Chad. What a coincidence. /s

* https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/glencoremapforweb.png?w=1024&amp;h=725

Meanwhile through all of this, the GDP of Chad has increased from $1.3 Billion in 2001 to $11 Billion in 2015. Almost 10x in just 20 years. Pretty good!

Guess what the revenue of Exxon and Glencore was in 2015, for comparison? More or less than Chad? Exxon had revenue of $218 Billion, and Glencore had revenue of $152 Billion. That's the yearly equivalent of 20 Chads and 14 Chads, respectively. 

You've heard of ""company towns"", where the town is basically owned by one company? Well this is a ""company nation"" and it's _far_ from the only one. 

So really what we are seeing in 2014 is Chevron effectively selling their 25% ownership of Chad to Glencore, and doing it through the Chadian government in a way so they're on the hook for over a billion dollars of additional debt. Debt slavery, but on a national scale, to a whole government. They're also contractually required to pay it off in just 4 years! I don't think they're going to make that payment schedule, which would end in 2018. I wonder what Glencore will demand in return for missed payments. What laws they will have the Chadian government make for them, in return for extending their debt deadlines. 

Now on top of all this, in the most recent twist, as of November 2016 the Chadian Government is now **suing Exxon for $74 Billion**. That is 5x the GDP of Chad.

At no point in that podcast did Professor Curry talk about “when it’s okay to kill white people.” He made his argument very clearly, and the mischaracterization is irresponsible and very dangerous, especially given this particular campus’ hostility toward expressions of Black agency at this university. This is the same university that had Richard Spencer, a known white nationalist speak at this fall.

Professor Curry’s argument was that the fantasy of retribution played out in Django Unchained needs to be contextualized in relation to the historical terms of the enslavement and state-sanctioned genocide of Black people, which is ongoing. White vigilantism against Black people, Natives, and immigrants has been a means of ensuring white economic and social superiority since the inception of this country. What Curry called for on the podcast was an examination of the ways in which this tradition of violent oppression is upheld by a rhetoric of peace that forecloses any conversation of when and where radical self-defense may be necessary for the Black community. He clearly states the question motivating his comments: “does the Black community have a need to protect itself?”

""During his speech, O'Reilly attacked those defending privacy protections and net neutrality as part of a 'progressive agenda to vanquish capitalism and economic liberty.'

This man thinks that Americans are all as dumb as Fred Phelps, Pat Roberston, and Roy Moore...

That's pretty insulting, but to be expected from the post-Goldwater GOP and from the warmongering neoconservative corporate ""Democrats"".

As far as I'm concerned, letting consumers, rather than monopolists and oligarchs, choose the services and the content that they wish to use, produce, and consume over the Internet on a fair and equal playing field is, in fact, a quintessential example of 'capitalism', 'economic liberty', and the 'free market' in action.

To suggest the opposite is as Orwellian as anything to have ever come out of Josef Stalin or Nicolae Ceausescu's asshole.

My formal knowledge in economics is limited to a first-year university course that I did reasonably well in and to whatever popular media and literature I've read ersatz about the subject, but the ability of a monopoly or an oligopoly to arbitrarily restrict supply, demand, price, and consumer choice is a special case of a negative externality impeding with the proper operation of the free market known as ""market failure"".

In this particular case, nobody can credibly argue that there is any meaningful social or economic benefit to be derived from allowing the free market to be hindered, and, as such, any credible economist, irrespective of other political or philosophical considerations, would argue for a regulatory framework that would prevent the monopolists and the oligarchs from interfering with the free market.

What many incumbent telco shills and self-described ""conservatives"" and ""libertarians"" (in practice, though, far-right corporatists) fail to understand here is that, in a monopoly situation, especially with respect to infrastructure, it is not only the government, but also private sector actors, that can interfere with the operation of the free market. They may condemn the big bad government for ""picking winners and losers"", but, in cases such as this, it is private-sector actors with no democratic accountability beyond bottom line and, perhaps, shareholder value that are doing the picking. 

In a liberal democracy, it thus becomes the obligation of democratically-elected governments, acting as tribunes for and stewards of the interests of the governed and of the political community as a whole (see Jean-Jacques Rousseau's concept of 'general will' vs 'particular will'), to correct this problem through effective intervening regulation, whether that be forcing the telcos to open their networks to third-party ISPs, whether that be a functional separation between those who own and operate the telecommunications networks and those who provide products, consumer and business services, and content over the networks, or whether that be full-on state ownership of these networks. 

Each political community must be empowered to choose the path that is right for the them in this respect, but it seems as though American ""conservatives"" still only care about ""state rights"", devolution, local option, and decentralized power when they can use them as dog whistles with which to retain dry counties, harass cannabis users, and beat up on African-Americans and the LGBTQ community.",Liberal,GritBusters,1,2,2017-05-18,1070,"GOPeons and Trumpanzees going after private rights online! http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/FCCS-ORielly-Wants-to-Ban-State-Broadband-Privacy-Protections-139597

What routes are left to fix the broken US government?,"Congress is corrupt. To fix congress, we have to bypass congress. Voting doesn't really work in a 2-party system where both parties are owned. And it seems protests are ineffective unless they are absolutely massive. What else can be done, without turning to violence?

One anti-corruption organization, represent.us, suggests the solution is to focus on sorting out local and state governments, and then the effects will ripple upwards. They actually created legislation and passed it in the state of South Dakota by popular vote. Then immediately it was found unconstitutional and was repealed through ""emergency measures"". Which sounds like corruption on first glance, but the bill was actually created by Soros and Rockefeller organizations, as the donor page shows: https://represent.us/donor-list/ The bill would've maintained the existing government, changing nothing, and then put on top of it another layer (the ""ethics committee"") that can fire anyone, and is appointed by the governor.  

So while the anti-corruption bill by represent.us _seems_ good on the face of it, the reality of the bill is that it was a power grab under the auspices of being an anti-corruption bill for the public good. The bill was opposed by the Koch Brothers. This means we have the leftist billionaires vs the rightist billionaires, both pretending to act in the benefit of the people, both vying for power over state and local governments. 

A second example: WolfPAC, started in 2011. It proposes to solve the problem with a constitutional amendment that is passed via state resolutions, rather than by congress. There are two ways to make a new constitutional amendment: 2/3 of each house of Congress can vote to propose an amendment, which is how it's usually done, or 2/3 of the states (34 states) can independently pass a resolution calling for a national convention to add an amendment. Then, ratification requires 3/4 of the states (38 states) to vote in support of an amendment before it becomes part of the Constitution. No congressional approval needed. The president can't veto it. This is true direct democracy. 

Vetting is needed to know if the WolfPAC resolution is genuinely anti-corruption or if it's pushed by billionaires looking to use it as a power grab, as is the case with represent.us. However they have managed to pass their resolution in 5 states already. 

America is heavily divided about a wide number of things, so proposing something that has broad support is difficult. It would have to be worded in a way that 3/4 of Americans approve of it, even in the face of twisted propaganda against it that would inevitably arise from the mainstream media to defend the establishment. So it would have to be very simple, without a lot of extras or baggage, and very direct. Then it has to be promoted. The media presence would be the trickiest part, most likely, because we wouldn't have billionaire help and the mainstream media would likely be working against us. 

If a good simple bill could be written, proper buzz could be generated about it, and some state votes were called, with enough attempts it could be passed in enough states to eventually amend the constitution. Or, get the laws changed on the state level so the effects ripple upward. Both approaches can be used in tandem, the state bill can be a slightly modified version of the state resolution. 

If you believe in the possibility of this approach, please spread the word.

Example of a Potential State Resolution &amp; Constitutional Amendment: 

* Change our voting system to a true multiparty system. End First-Past-The-Post.

* Undo and disallow all gerrymandering.

* No more revolving door between industry/lobbying and regulatory positions. At least a minimum of 7 years wait before going from one side to the other.

"Statistics: Republicans outspent Democrats in the GA-6 primary ($10 million to $6 million). 67% of donations to Ossoff campaign were &lt;$200. 87-90% of Republican spending came from PACs and self-funded aristocrat candidates, only 10-13% from donations.","This ballotpedia article has a section on spending: https://ballotpedia.org/April_18_special_election_in_Georgia's_6th_Congressional_District

I looked at the data in this article and did a lot of calculations. Feel free to check my work.

*******

**1: Fundraising:**

Jon Ossoff's campaign raised **$8.32 million**, of which **5.6 million** came from small donors (**67%**). The rest presumably from large individual donors. The other Democrats combined got **less than $100 thousand** in contributions.

For the Republican candidates, Moody self-funded his campaign with **$2 million**, and Bob Gray loaned his campaign **0.5 million** of his own dollars. Gray also got roughly **$220 thousand** in additional contributions. Judson Hill got **$523 thousand** in contributions, and Karen Handel got **$464 thousand** in contributions. It is not known what percentages of the Republican donors were large or small.

Most of the Republican contributions came in the form of PAC spending on pro-Republican or anti-Ossoff advertisements.

*******

**2: Spending:**

Adding together all pro-Democrat spending, the rough **total for Democrats** is **$6.26 million** (of which **$6.18 million** was by the Ossoff campaign, the rest by the other Dem candidates).

Note that the Ossoff campaign saved about 25% of their money (**over $2 million**) for the runoff election.

And the rough **total for Republicans** is **$9.855 million** if you only count anti-Dem or pro-Rep spending, and **$10.155 million** if you include $300 thousand in intra-party Republican attack ads paid for by the Club for Growth PAC.

This means **97%** of Republican spending was anti-Dem or pro-Rep, only **3%** spent on intra-party attacks (this is a primary election, remember). (Also Moody ran an ad against Handel, I don't what percent of his spending that represents).

Between **$1.29 million (12.7%**) and **$1.07 million (10.5%)** of Republican spending was from campaign contributions^1 (depending on how much of his own money Gray spent). The rest was from PACs (**6.9 million, 68%**) and from self-funded rich candidates (Between **$2.2 million, 22%** and **$1.97 million, 19%**).

And about **$11 thousand** were spent by the 2 independent candidates.

**PAC spending summary:** Club for Growth (Rep): **$300 thousand**. NRCC (Rep): **$2 million**. Ending Spending (Rep): **$0.5 million**. Congressional Leadership Fund (Rep): **$4.1 million**. As noted earlier, CFG was intra-party attack ads, the rest were pro-Rep or anti-Ossoff. DCCC (Dem): One radio ad, **cost unknown**.

*******

**Additional Unaccounted Spending**

The DCCC (Dem) also spent money on a radio ad featuring the celebrity Samuel L Jackson, but it is not known how much was spent on it, so I didn't include it in the calculations.

The DCCC (Dem), NRCC (Rep), and RNC (Rep) spent money to increase the number of Democratic/Republican staffers in the district (by +9D, +5R, and +9R respectively), but it is not known how much any of them spent, so this was not included in the calculations.

*******

1. (I calculated Republican ""spending due to contributions"" by adding all non-PAC spending and subtracting 1.8 million which was spent by Moody, who was 95% self-funded, and subtracting different amounts due to Gray, who got some contributions but also loaned his own campaign $0.5 million. Since Gray raised about $220 thousand in contributions and spent about $320 thousand, he had to have spent at least $100 thousand of his own dollars. So his ""self-fund spending"" was anywhere between $100,000 and $320,000, and these bounds are reflected in the numbers I give.

Made a chart of data showing how expensive and ineffective the US health system is,"[Here is the chart](http://i.imgur.com/vjNwI17.png)
I hope this gives some ammo to people in advocating universal health care.


After each country's name, you will see several columns:


**Column C ""government spending (% of GDP on Health)""** shows what part of the whole economy the Government spends on health.  


   As you can see, even though they have ""government health care"" most ""socialized"" systems spend less than the US Government does.
 


**Column D ""Private Spending (% of GDP on Health)""** shows the *extra* money that citizens have to pay for health.  This is where the USA gets hammered.


**Column E ""Total part of GDP spent on Health""** Just adds up the two prior columns.  Notice that JUST one part of US spending (just private or just govt. spending) exceeds the total spending of many nations.


**Columns H and I** show the total money we could save as a nation, or per person, if we had a health system that was as inexpensive as the other countries'.  For example, if we copied the Canadian system, the US Govt could save $1.26 Trillion every year.  That is $3,942.88 for every person in the USA.  


**The rest of the columns show the health outcomes** - life expectancy, infant mortality, what percent of people are covered, waiting periods and financial impacts.

For example, if we copied the Canadian system, the US Govt could save $1.26 Trillion every year.  That is $3,942.88 for every person in the USA.  


**The rest of the columns show the health outcomes** - life expectancy, infant mortality, what percent of people are covered, waiting periods and financial impacts.

Trump's firing of U.S. Attorney might be related to Mr. Bharara becoming a nightmare for all the insider traders in the Wall Street including many of Trump's friends and associates in New York.,"Yes, by firing of Preet Bharara Trump has shown that he doesn't want to clean the swamp in Washington or elsewhere in the country, especially in New York where Trump grew up and where most of Trump's shady businesses are located.

Otherwise why Trump would kick out a very respected and well known U.S. Attorney like Mr. Bharara whom he promised to keep once he took total control of this country.

The question that comes to everybody's mind is maybe Mr. Bharara was too close to finding some shady deals that Trump was engaged in.

Maybe all of Trump's ruse that he was against Wall Street was nothing but to distract all of his followers from the fact that he himself had made heavy involvements with the sharks of Wall Street.

And given his very close relationship with the winners of Wall Street like Mr. Carl Icahn and Mr. Barack, Trump might've used a very significant amount of his own money through a very heavy investments in the range of billions of dollars in the stock market. 

Probably most of the venture capitalists whom Mr. Bharara was trying to put behind bars are frequent visitors to the Trump Tower exchanging pleasantries as well as sheer cash.

So it might've become quite obvious to Mr. Trump that this man Mr. Preet Bharara whom he promised to keep in his position as a Wall Street enforcer, is now becoming a pain in Trump's butt.

Otherwise why Trump would kick out a very respected and well known U.S. Attorney like Mr. Bharara whom he promised to keep once he took total control of this country.

The question that comes to everybody's mind is maybe Mr. Bharara was too close to finding some shady deals that Trump was engaged in.

Maybe all of Trump's ruse that he was against Wall Street was nothing but to distract all of his followers from the fact that he himself had made heavy involvements with the sharks of Wall Street.

And given his very close relationship with the winners of Wall Street like Mr. Carl Icahn and Mr. Barack, Trump might've used a very significant amount of his own money through a very heavy investments in the range of billions of dollars in the stock market. 

Probably most of the venture capitalists whom Mr. Bharara was trying to put behind bars are frequent visitors to the Trump Tower exchanging pleasantries as well as sheer cash.

So it might've become quite obvious to Mr. Trump that this man Mr. Preet Bharara whom he promised to keep in his position as a Wall Street enforcer, is now becoming a pain in Trump's butt.

Only the G.O.P. could tolerate these type of totally racist hate mongers in their party for so long.","Yes, for a very long time, Republican party members were winning their local,state and national elections by taking full advantages of their core supporters' lack of education.

And what does lack of education bring : utter ignorance.

Steve King,the congressman from Iowa was taking full advantage of his followers' ignorance to spread his hate filled diatribe which're similar to the views of all the White Nationalists here as well as Geert Wilders, a far-right  Dutch politician and many others like him in Europe whose racist world views match with Trump and Mr. King's.

But Mr. King who branded together all the children coming from South America with a few drug smugglers saying ""these young immigrants have calves like cantaloupe,from hauling marijuana over the border,"" do not understand that by painting other people with black color he's asking those people to hate all the White Americans.

And that'll be totally antithesis of what almost 200+ millions of White Americans stand for.

These great Americans couldn't make their candidate Hillary win because of direct interference in our election process by Putin and Mr. Comey, but they'd never talk like some racist bastards from the other side of the spectrum in their lives.

Also by blaming the Democrats for trying to ""fill the void of nearly 60 million aborted babies since 1973, by raising somebody else's babies,"" Mr. King proved to us that he and Trump want to turn all the  Americans like them. Totally racist monsters.

And that talk from Mr. King about ""raising other people's babies"" was the dumbest thing that any politician can ever say on national tv, because we're not raising other people's babies but our own American babies.

Those babies might look different from Mr. King's color of the skin or his cultures or different in their religious views but nonetheless if they're born in America like Obama was, they're American citizens.

And if some babies or children left their countries in the South America because of our neglect or direct involvement in those countries' insecurity, then it becomes incumbent on us to accept those babies or children and give them shelter, food and a chance to lead a decent life in our great country.

But for Trump and Mr. King to talk in such generalized terms about these babies and also other refugees, who're coming to our country because of the Republican party's deliberate attempt to subvert those countries in the middle-east and in Latin America, these two Republican blowhards and many others like them are proving to us and the whole world that they do not want America to progress or go forward.

Their main intention is to take us back to those dark old days of '50s when the minorities were treated like cattle in this country with no power to vote, no liberty, justice and personal freedom as is enshrined in gold letters in our Bill of Rights for all the Americans irrespective of their color of the skin or their different cultures and their different than us customs as well as freedom to worship any God they wanted to. 

But to Trump and these racists monsters like Mr. King from the other side of the isles in Congress, our Constitution means nothing.

Actually to Trump who never read the Constitution and Steve King who read it, our Bill of Rights be damned. It's just their way for all the Americans or else the highway.

In fact if they've enough votes, the Republicans in Congress will amend each and every clauses written in our Constitution, especially the clauses written in the Bill of Rights.

Their hatred for other people, who don't look like them or don't speak like them or don't pray to the Gods like them, is so intense that these bunch of racist Republicans led by Trump and Mr. King will pass 20+ more amendments to our Constitution to take away all the rights as our original writers of the Constitution wanted everyone in this country to have irrespective of their political or moral differences.

"After going to the White House,Trump has no clue how to tackle a rogue leader from North Korea. Before the election he was about to snuff the daylight out of Kim Jong-un's life.","Yes, if only Trump could listen to any reason that others suggest to him, he could achieve a lot in his first 54 days in office.

But since he won only through his bombast beside the help of Putin and Mr. Comey, he doesn't have a clue what is diplomacy and how it works.

He's just chugging along with his never ending lies for everything he said on his campaign trails like his boastful lie about the merits of Trumpcare, saying his bill will be 300% better than Obamacare.

But when the crunch time comes of how to tackle North Korea's Kim Jong-un, most probably our only talk,talk, talk president Trump, who puts no substance behind his bombast, will lower his tail and run from the responsibility for which a president is elected.

His silence on the subject of bombing North Korea since he sat down in the White House, is so deafening that even a 10 year old arm wrestler would've pulled a mad dog leader from Pyongyang by his tail without uttering a word.

But not Trump, who's so busy hearing about the billions of dollars' worth of businesses that his two adult sons are procuring from all over the world that the existentialist threat that North Korea imposes on us by directing their Nuclear missiles towards our California shores, is not much of a deal for him.

By saying we got huge stock of nuclear arsenals in our own nuclear silos is not going to protect our citizens in California from a one strike nuclear hit from the world's most egocentric leader of North Korea.

But what Trump is failing to realize is that even a small plutonium bomb that North Korea is currently engaged in perfecting to place it on top of their missiles and sending them towards our mainland will be strong enough a signal to destabilize our whole country and also the whole world. 

That's why Trump should follow one out of the three following options :  bomb, acquiesce or negotiate if he wants to protect our lives from Nuclear Holocaust as argued by Mr. Robert Litwak from the Wilson Center.

Obama, whom Trump criticized for making the worst nuclear deal with Iran, was right in negotiating with Iran instead of bombing Iranian nuclear facilities that was ""hot"".

'Bombing them could've untold consequences in terms of radioactivity', as per an article in NYT today . 

By 'acquiescing North Korea to a breakout will mean this failed state could --incredibly become a major power with a global reach' as per the same article.

So Trump must show us that he really cares for our lives by 'negotiating' with Kim Jong-un and cut a nuclear deal with North Korea similar to what Obama struck with Iran and got a commitment from the Ayatollahs of their country that they'd agree to a 15-year halt on processing weapons-usable fissile material in return for significant sanctions relief.(source : NYT).

Best Left-Wing Podcast?,"Hi, I'm looking for recommendations for left-wing news podcasts to round out my news media consumption.

2.)Whenever we played doctor I let other kids die if they came in with pre-existing conditions.

3.)I'd listen to a girl have a good idea. Then I'd patiently wait for a little boy to the have the same idea before I threw my support behind it.

4.)When it came time to vote for class president, I deliberately voted against my own interests, instead opting for whomever could simplify issues that required nuance, especially if they promised to make certain things great again.

5.)When playing with my toys, I sent G.I. Joe to break up meetings and arrest people when my other toys tried to unionize.

Obscure Opinion: We Need Enough Lithium In Our Tapwater.,"I have an obscure political opinion. It is the government's responsibility to ensure there's enough lithium in the drinking water to promote public health and safety. I'm not talking about a large amount of lithium though. 100µg/L-150µg/L is enough. Why?

Four epidemiological studies, one in Texas, one in Japan, on in Greece, and one in Austria, found that counties with a higher level of lithium in the water had lower rates of suicide. The Texas study also found that more lithium was associated with lower rates of murder and sexual assault.

Lithium is also neuroprotective. In animal models it has been shown to reduce behavioural and cognitive deficits associated with neurodegenerative disease.

Lithium also increases lifespan. Studies in flies and worms find that those that consume lithium have longer lifespans. And and an epidemiological study in Japan found that those with higher levels of lithium in their drinking water lived longer, even after adjusting for suicide.

More studies should be done on suicide and violent crime rates, but I think there's enough information out there to make this a political issue. The precedent for a program like this is already set due to the fluoride in our tapwater.

(Alt)Right Point of View,"Let me preface this by saying that I do not fully agree with the points I am about to present, as I believe cultural diversity is usually a good thing, and that in the face of many cultures, the better aspects of each will be the ones that prevail.

But I wanted to come here to represent the Conservative/Right Winged/Alternate Right point of view when it comes to immigration/cultural diversity, as it seems people positioned in the left often like to write off their ideas as racist and leave it at that, and it pains me to see that, as whenever the labels like that come out, it essentially cuts off discourse and the points of view they are bringing to the table are then failed to be talked about and understood, and I believe that even if you don't agree with said viewpoints, anyone who holds strong political viewpoints should respect their opponents enough to at least understand their viewpoints. An example of this is what happened in Berkeley, and as someone who identifies as center-left, it makes me only want to distance myself from the liberal movement as much as possible, even though I share those base ideals. Milo holds classical conservative viewpoints that are in no way racist/homophobic, especially considering he is a gay man who can't shut up about how he loves black dick. But people who have failed to give his ideas a fair hearing show up to protest his *right to speak*. They rioted at Berkeley in order to silence his ideas, and this is the definition of suppression and infringement upon free speech, things in which the liberal movement once stood against.

Now to stop rambling and actually get to the points I want to. Liberals seem to think that wanting immigration laws/deportation of immigrants/control over specifically Muslim immigrants is racist in the sense that it is simply about the race of the people entering the country. But it's not about that, it's about the *culture*. People who hold classical Christian/Western values simply want it to stay that way. While I can't agree with this viewpoint I can sympathize with it. The media does not do this point of view justice, featuring almost exclusively faaaaar right white nationalists who actually are racist, then acting like these men lead the army of the demonized alt right. I love Mexican culture and think there are many cool aspects to it that could be integrated into our culture, but many don't believe the same as me. The fear of Muslims entering the country is something I believe is a little bit more justified. Muslim ideals clash with Western ideals in many ways. Unlike most religions, Islam believes that it's laws should be imposed upon all, even those who do not follow Islam. And these laws are quite scary to them, in fact if someone were to be a straight ""by the book"" Muslim, they would believe that non Muslims should be converted or killed. Now not all Muslims are by the book such as that, but they follow the religion that technically holds these values. Alternatively, in Muslim culture, Woman are incredibly oppressed, an issue that is quite core to the liberal movement today. Conservatives are scared of the dilution of their own culture for values that they believe to be worse than their own, and most couldn't give give a flying fuck about the skin color of the person who holds those values.

Now not all Muslims are by the book such as that, but they follow the religion that technically holds these values. Alternatively, in Muslim culture, Woman are incredibly oppressed, an issue that is quite core to the liberal movement today. Conservatives are scared of the dilution of their own culture for values that they believe to be worse than their own, and most couldn't give give a flying fuck about the skin color of the person who holds those values.

15/30 top rated posts today are from r/thedonald. Wtf Reddit?! Why are we watching this?,"Hi Reddit,

I am a long time lurker and love surfing hot and top rated posts on Reddit. In the past weeks I have noticed a change in the frequency of some type of posts and I feel like it represents an issue that is prevalent in today's societies. 

Here is what I noticed: Most of the top rated posts on a per day basis are from r/thedonald. (In the past weeksish) I am neither a Donald nor Hillary fan, but most of these posts are complete racist one sided shit that make muslims look bad. Go check the top posts today and you will find racist people hating on foreign people that immigrated to the US and committed crimes. Of course that is bad stuff, but it's not like every Muslim or middle eastern person that came to the US is a criminal and should not be admitted anymore. While I can differentiate such shit posts, many are not able to. 

That's where my point is going. The ""educated"" part of Reddit keeps its mouth shut and surfs for quality content, while ignoring lots of BS. Those that enjoy racist posts scream the loudest and upvote such content regularly. Like in real life.

Those that are labeled or label themselves educated and smart don't vote - while those that are basically retarded scream the loudest and make every vote count. 

This leads to Reddit becoming a racist shithole and Trump being elected. While retards give it all to be heard, the rest just sits back and watches it happen.

Wake up Reddit. Either you do something agains it or you watch the idiots rule. 

Tldr: Extremists engage strongly while liberals lay back and let them rule.

Why I am a Liberal,"*“Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.”* ~ Martin Luther King Jr.


Given current events, I feel compelled to speak up. And I believe speaking up is something that must be done now by everyone who can speak and in every way possible for them to speak. I have no human right to judge the ideas of others unless those ideas cause harm and incite hate. Likewise, I have a human imperative to try and do no harm myself and understand that I may be accurately criticized for my ideas if I am wrong. 

Now that would be a very smug attitude without some core ideas that I can defend as being central to humanity. My politics have always consisted of not really caring. I've been exposed enough to know geopolitics on an academic level. But not because I really cared about it. Politics was once boring. I vote. Well, honestly sometimes. I damn sure voted this time.

But here we are on the edge of history. 


Below are the core ideas I wish to politically defend going into the future. It will be a somewhat short list with few details. Details in this case are not needed.

1) All people need affordable health care.

2) We must have professional and compassionate care for the elderly.

3) People need access to shelter and food support if they cannot support themselves.

4) Freedom requires responsibility. This applies to personal firearms and the use of military lives. It must be reasoned, honest and only for defense.

5) The truth if demonstrated through evidence is the truth until the evidence changes. Science is how you understand things.

6) Your religion is your religion and you are free to exercise it only because I am free from it. No matter what you believe, you cannot legislate that to me. Keep yours to you and I will keep mine to me.

I believe if we all do these things. We will all be better individuals and a better society. I am not trying to dictate how we get to these things. Much smarter people than me have already done pretty much this all around the world. I'm not asking for utopia. 

So if I have to be a ""liberal"" saying crazy sh*t on /reddit - those above things are what I have to say.

(Notice how I didn't go there all current eventy. sad.)

I am a liberal, I guess. I make both sides mad on most issues. But here I am.

"Liberals, atheists and Islam","I don't know how much you've been paying attention to this, but from what I understand, there are liberals going after atheists like Bill Maher (a big liberal, btw) and Sam Harris for their position on Islam being - as Harris has said - ""the mother lode of bad ideas"".

The air he breathes is clean because some environmentalist wacko liberal fought for laws to stop industries from polluting our air. 
He walks to the subway station for his government-subsidized ride to work. It saves him considerable money in parking and transportation fees because some fancy-pants liberal fought for affordable public transportation, which gives everyone the opportunity to be a contributor.
Joe begins his work day. He has a good job with excellent pay, medical benefits, retirement, paid holidays and vacation because some lazy liberal union members fought and died for these working standards. Joes employer pays these standards because Joe's employer doesn't want his employees to call the union.

It's noontime and Joe needs to make a bank deposit so he can pay some bills. 
Joe's deposit is federally insured by the FSLIC because some godless liberal wanted to protect Joe's money from unscrupulous bankers who ruined the banking system before the Great Depression.
Joe has to pay his Fannie Mae-underwritten mortgage and his below-market federal student loan because some elitist liberal decided that Joe and the government would be better off if he was educated and earned more money over his lifetime.

He plans to visit his father this evening at his farm home in the country.

How to destroy any Republican with one question. Don't debate ever again. Try this instead!,"Next time you encounter a Republican ask them this question. ""Can you point to any country on earth that has a small government,strong economy and middle class, with low taxes, is a democracy, and is ruled by the richest one percent of the population""?. Just one example in the whole world? LOL

And if you really wanna have fun with them even more. You can ask them if they can name any country in the history of mankind that has ever followed that formula to success. They are both trick questions because there are no countries on earth that have that formula. The only thing close would be considered a third world country like Somalia. 

So don't waste your time debating with them. Just show them that their whole ideology of small government, with low taxes, a free democracy, with a strong economy and middle class, ruled by the wealthiest people in the country. Doesn't even exist in real life anywhere on earth. And if they attack you to point to some progressive success stories. You can inform them according to Forbes a right wing business site. And national geographic a left wing organization.


 They both have ranked the top ten happiest countries on earth. According to wealth, and overall health, and freedom. And they all have a big government with strong social safety nets, slightly higher taxes, and our ruled by the professional class of people. Everyone of the top ten happiest countries all follow a progressive liberal platform.  So that means the score is ten strong reasons to zero. Have fun with this one and watch their heads explode!

So don't waste your time debating with them. Just show them that their whole ideology of small government, with low taxes, a free democracy, with a strong economy and middle class, ruled by the wealthiest people in the country. Doesn't even exist in real life anywhere on earth. And if they attack you to point to some progressive success stories. You can inform them according to Forbes a right wing business site. And national geographic a left wing organization.


 They both have ranked the top ten happiest countries on earth. According to wealth, and overall health, and freedom. And they all have a big government with strong social safety nets, slightly higher taxes, and our ruled by the professional class of people. Everyone of the top ten happiest countries all follow a progressive liberal platform.  So that means the score is ten strong reasons to zero. Have fun with this one and watch their heads explode! Peace!

Help for a new candidate?,"Hello all. 

I am currently in the beginning steps of running for school board in Minnesota. I'm really excited to actually get off the sidelines and get to work to oppose DeVos for real on the front lines. 

I recently received a scholarship ticket to a campaign candidate training event in Raleigh, NC where Mayor Pete is a keynote (a personal model of whom I'd like to emulate). This was a great boon to me and I've been looking forward to it immensely. 

Drawback is, while I can afford one, it looks like I can't afford both airfare and hotel (each of which ~$300). Does anyone know of any resources I could track down in order to not miss this exciting opportunity?

Thesis Paper on Allyship,"Hello all! My time in college is coming to an end, and I am working on a thesis paper. The survey below (and paper that it will inform) stems from the realization that though I wish to identify as an ally for social justice, I do very little to earn the title. Though I am well-read, friendly, and conscious of my role within supremacy, I unconsciously perpetuate hegemonic racial hierarchies and use my whiteness to take advantage of a system that benefits me at the expense of others. My knowledge and friendliness is not enough, and I understand that I need to do better if I truly want social justice and to be an ally. But how? What does it mean to be an ally, and who gets to determine what that means for them? Is the discursive practice of speaking for others ever a valid practice, and if so, what are the criteria for validity? What complexities emerge from not just allyship as a whole, but white allyship in particular? Most importantly for myself and many others, how does a white person enact allyship without falling into a trap of interest convergence or narcissism?

What follows is a series of questions intended to provide a qualitative and quantitative framework for understanding the definitions, misconceptions, and complexities that allyship entails. To help me write my paper and become a better person, please answer in as much depth as you feel comfortable providing and in correspondence with those that pertain to yourself. (e.g. If you identify as white, do not answer the questions addressed for people of color and vice versa).

Healthcare as a Right in America,"Hello /r/liberal!

Up until now I have not given much thought to the healthcare debate in America. Nothing changed for me when we switched to ACA, and its unlikely anything will change for me with the repeal/replacement of the ACA. I work in an industry where good healthcare is almost always provided by the employer, so my situation will likely not change unless there are radical changes to healthcare in the United States.

I have decided I want to start looking into this issue though, and I got hung up on an important moral question. Is healthcare a right?

I don't care about opinions on the implementations of the ACA or any replacement of the ACA. Nor do I care much about personal stories. I want to know:

**Is healthcare in America a right? Why or Why not?**

I would appreciate it if you focused on the why or why not part, and if your answer is no, I would love to know where you think healthcare becomes a right, ie access, right to singlepayer but keep private industry, or it is a privilege not a right, ect. 

Please only respond if you are going to answer the Why? part. I am not here to debate anyone, but I might ask clarifying questions to probe deeper into your viewpoint on the matter. Also, please don't debate anyone in the comments, I don't care about your response to someone's viewpoint and debate often turns into petty bickering. If you have an opposing viewpoint let me know what it is and why you hold it.

When Trump finally does his farewell speech,"Trump's farewell speech:

Hey people,

Before I begin I would just like to say what an honor it has been for you, to have me as your president. It's been so much fun folks, hasn't it? It's been fun. Here's a list of my accomplishments:

We set up Trumpcare to provide reasonable, cost-effective cosmetic surgery to those unfortunate women who are a 7 or uglier.
Our ""Soylent Verde"" program provided food to hard-working white middle class Americans while simultaneously decreasing the amount of undocumented immigrants.

The creation, spearheaded by Vice President Pence, of a literal Bathroom Police to keep our kids safe from transgender weirdos hell-bent on peeing alone in a stall.

The Platinum statue of Ben Carson I've had built in every major housing project, to remind the blacks that any adversity they face is their fault for not becoming a doctor.

I shrunk the amount of money we owe CHY-NAH from $1.115 trillion to only $3 Trillion. Nothing after the decimal point, folks! I did that.

All these accomplishments, all of these gains I couldn't have done without me. I was really great, folks. There were other people too, who played a minor role in making this country great again but for I get to them I would just like to say that the following women are still fat cows:
Rosie O'Donnell.
Megyn Kelley.
Meryl Streep.
Elizabeth Warren.
The little girl that said ""Mommy why is that man orange"" in restaurant this morning.

All of these people are losers. Sad, folks, isn't it? So sad. I poke fun, folks. But in the words of the great Joffrey Baratheon, ""everyone is mine to torment.""

And now for the people who stood by me, and watched supportively while I did all the important work:

Chris Christie, my favorite drink coaster. Because you know, sometimes you need to set your drink down so you can grab a woman by-- anyway, thank you Chris, for getting on all fours so I can set my Sierra Mist down. I'm gonna put some of the good food in your bowl tonight.

To my wife Melania, for not gaining that much weight.
To my daughter Ivanka, for making promises to women I had no intention of keeping, and convincing women long enough for me to get elected. I love you Ivanka, you're like a second mistress to me.

To my sons Eric And Donald Jr., Donald, it was one of my proudest moments as a parent when I was able to grab the camera and film baby's first bankruptcy. The douche doesn't fall for from the bag. Eric, you're kind of a loser.

We only have a few more minutes before CHY-NAH penetrates the barracades so I just want to say that I've been great, it's been fun being your last president, and you might want to run now because the soldiers are pouring in.

"Why all these ""LIBERALISM OWNED"" videos are BS that prevents conservatives from challenging their beliefs","Hello fellow lefties. If you've been on Youtube recently, you'll likely have noticed quite a few videos with titles that go like this: 

""[Far-right commentator] DESTROYS [left issue/commentator]"". 

Here's an example:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5LeFo1EJU
""Ben Shapiro utterly demolishes Black Lives Matter once and for all""

In this video, Breitbart ""journalist"" Ben Shapiro is debating the existence of institutional racism. Despite the title, the issue at hand is clearly not BLM, but the Baltimore riots of 2015; however, the argument would likely be the same either way. Shapiro has been asked to explain how some unspecified disparity is not caused by institutional racism, and his response is that black ""culture"" is to blame for the inequalities, rather than the system itself.

Shapiro follows this claim with a series of rhetorical questions: ""Explain to ME why black kids aren't graduating high school...explain to ME why black kids are shooting each other in rates significantly higher than whites are shooting each other...explain to me why the number of black kids in prison...is so high...if it has nothing to do with culture, explain to ME why the single motherhood rate in the black community jumped from 20% to 70%...""

That's a VERY heavy argument to make, and at first glance, he seems to have the evidence to back it up. But if you think about it, you'll realize that these trends he cites DON'T ACTUALLY SERVE AS EVIDENCE FOR HIS CLAIM--they're just the ""effect"" part of the cause-and-effect statement that constitutes his entire argument.

Shapiro’s claim boils down to this: ""Blacks are naturally more violent than whites, and that is what causes all these lopsided trends. Any other theory about what causes these inequalities is false."" 

The problem with this is that these trends could just as easily be caused by pressures of poverty and discrimination. That's what's missing from his argument: the part where he explains WHY the liberal theories on these inequalities are false. Instead, he challenges his opponents to ""explain"" to him why he is wrong, and never allows them the opportunity to do so. Everything he says is just an undisputed claim disguised as a logical, proven argument.

And yet as Shapiro makes his ""points"", the audience replies with applause. That's how you know they already agree with everything he has to say--otherwise, they would question the fact that no one  actually attempts to ""explain"" to him why they think he's wrong. This is why these “debate” videos are so popular: for making solid points, they're worthless, because ONLY ONE SIDE MAKES ITS ARGUMENT AND DOESN’T SUPPORT IT WITH REAL EVIDENCE, but for confirming prejudices, they're great, because if you watch them already believing what the conservative speaker is saying, you think your beliefs are being proven true, when in reality they are never actually being called into question or supported with evidence.

This particular pseudo-argument, when examined closely, carries some disturbing undertones--according to Shapiro, black people cause all their own problems because they are inherently more violent than white people. If that sentiment sounds familiar, you may recognize it under another name: WHITE SUPREMACISM. Shapiro’s line of thinking is perfect for confirming the belief of far-rightists--not only does it unconditionally satisfy their belief that the system is perfect and institutional racism does not exist, it absolves them of any guilt or obligation to change their behavior, and it confirms any racist preconceptions they may have that black people are naturally inferior to white people.

Objectively, Ben Shapiro doesn’t “utterly demolish” any liberal issue, but conservatives don’t see that because WHAT HE’S SAYING FEELS GOOD. Videos like these are part of the reason why the right has become so zealous recently--they fill up on these junk food videos that don’t challenge their beliefs in any way, and they shut themselves off from all other opinions, convinced that their point of view is the only one that is logical and correct. If someone you know shows you these videos as proof that liberalism is false, do your best to convince them that they are wasting their time, and engage in a logical discussion--it would be good for you both.

 * increased prevalence of corruption (e.g. appointees)

Anyone live in a state with Republican senators or a district with a Republican congress person?,"There are a couple of issues coming up with the new administration that have bothered me.

http://democracy.foundation/similar-projects/

I know you are probably aware of this but consider this, If you ruled the world and decided one day, because you are a nice person, that you wish to know the desires of your people, and you really meant it, would you?

A). Have people design all different kinds of Organizations that work in different ways, with different questions to answer, and then take all that and try to figure out what the people want.

                   OR

B). Get the best people together you can to build one system using the best agreed-upon technology,(Google search engines).

The founding fathers of the United States did not decide to ""farm out"" the voting process to a variety different organizations for this obvious reason.

All those other direct democracy initiatives require you to traverse menus, and answer questions. The limited amount of data they are working with and their use of questions, makes it unfeasible for them to use search engines.

Removing questions enables google style search engines, which then enables unlimited data, which then allows for a monopoly on the opinion market, owned by the ""people"".

The ease of expressing your opinions on anything, all in one location, with no menus, will have a compounding effect on participation.

But there is something even more important we would like to show you, in the natural process, when a small group of people are trying to find consensus, suggestions and ideas are put forward by any one or more individuals in the group. 

Informal voting takes place. 

Based on that information, more suggestions may emerge.

This process is repeated until the highest level of satisfaction is achieved.

Only then is the vote official. The free flow of unofficial voting is essential.

We would like to add that various voting reforms are attempts to supplement for our inability to provide, the free flow of unofficial voting. we are recreating this on a worldwide scale.

It only takes 5 mins a week to make your voice heard to Washington.,"I have saved my states 2 senators Washington phone numbers in my contacts. I am political junkie and call them on the way home from work to let them know what I don't want them to do. All the senators and congressman from my state are republicans (we just voted out our last den congressman, sad) On a podcast called Congressional Dish, Jennifer Briney goes through bills the house is going through or has gone through and I call my states people. Once of her guests was an old cronies from Washington and he said that phone calls count for 10 phone calls and emails count like double or something. So calling is your best bet. I used to email but after Trump got in I was pissed and I wanted my phone call to count as 10 people pissed off.

Some thoughts on the situation we're in.,"Things aren't going well, to say the least, at the moment.  President Trump is hellbent on undoing everything Obama did.  But we can recover and be stronger.  Liberalism is stronger than Trumpism.  And once we rise from the ashes, we will accomplish wonderful things.  One thing I'm concerned about, though, is the Republican Party's sickness.  Liberalism can't exist without conservatism.  They kinda balance each other out.  What we can do is recognize principled Republicans who are knowledgeable, like Evan McMullin, Lindsey Graham, and Condoleeza Rice.  They are the best of the Republican Party.  We must not fall into the trap of populism and demagogues.  I live in West Virginia, where we send Joe Manchin, a soft-spoken centrist Democrat, to the Senate, as well as Shelly Moore Capito, who was attacked in the primaries for being too liberal of a Republican and is one of the most productive members of the Senate.  West Virginia isn't as hillbilly and kooky as we seem at first.  I'm distressed at how many people on the left seem keen on writing them off as idiots.

Guilt as a liberal investing in oil and bank stocks?,"So I'm trying to come to terms with my investment portfolio as I structure it to benefit from the changes that will occur over the next four years.

I have a hard line where I would never invest in things I consider inherently morally bankrupt (yet potentially fiscally profitable) like tobacco companies, arms / ammunition companies and defense contractors. 

However, it seems to me that under this new administration there will be a substantial reduction in regulations and corporate taxes that will benefit oil companies and big banks (who will also benefit from the rising rate environment). 

While I am fundamentally opposed to these policies, I have chose to invest in sector ETFs like XLE (for energy) and VFH (for bank), as well as taking positions in JP Morgan/Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BA), TRow Price (TROW) and Visa (V)/Mastercard (MA).  I also have small positions in some regional banks. 

I say this because I have made decisions that while some banks (Goldman, Citi) or oil companies (BP) or Dakota Access Pipeline (ETP) are too much to swallow, I really shouldn't cut off my nose to spite my face.

A View From Inside,"An old friend posted this on Facebook.  It's long but well worth reading.  Multiply it by a couple hundred and it illustrates just a little of what we're all up against. 

A VIEW FROM THE INSIDE OF THE OTHER SIDE
Last night I attended a Pro-President “little d” meeting. My summary will be a bit long, however, I want to pass on what we learned,
In the Art of War it is always advised to know what your enemy is doing, that is why there are spies. Two of the groups I’m involved with have a committee that is subscribed to little d’s supporters newsletters, are members of various FB groups (with specially created profiles) and are on his mailing list for updates.
Last night 3 of us went to a group meeting. Two women and one man. What we saw and heard was both scary and informative.
The meeting was led by 5 men and we counted approximately 70 people in the room including us. We counted 13 women.
They started the meeting with a pledge of allegiance to the flag. Then they jumped into discussions, the first being the Marches. It was a lot of WTF and why don’t they just shut up. They discussed the report that there were no arrests so that meant that the police and the media were lying. The leader(s) then gave them an “action item” to find anything to dispute the no arrests report and to put pressure on the police to arrest protestors. Several people in the group admitted to being at the March to try to interfere, but felt they were bullied by the Marchers and had to stop “for their own safety” (actual quote). They questioned why so many people “got away with it” (Marching). It seemed to be a hot point with them.
The moved on to reports from the teams. They have teams and committees with specific tasks, ie: daily phone calls and collect tally’s of who makes phone calls to their Reps. It appears they call throughout the day, and each call is either a different issue or their personal favorite.
They have a team who monitor the public blogs and event postings of the Liberal groups (specifically mentioned Indivisible and MoveOn.) They laughed at the Indivisible Guide when one leader said “the Liberals will never get organized and carry any of this out, the snowflakes give up too easily, a little heat and they melt”. They talked about the “visit your representatives office event” that was planned for earlier in the day which was posted on MoveOn and all over FB. They also were at their reps offices, and a handful admitted to going to the Democratic representatives office in their own district to have their voice counted.
They have a team who spies on FB posts. When the man who was with us asked how to do it, he was told that if he was a member of Pantsuit Nation it’s almost an automatic in into most closed groups, and then once you are in one, you can get invited to others. Someone on their team joins all the public and open groups. Their report included reading a few actual posts, in a mimic whining voice, where the members were posting their concerns and frustrations and why bother. They actually cheered this. One leader applauded the report and said, “we don’t care if they like what we have to say, we don’t need them to agree with us. We just need them to give up, shut up and stay out of our way.”
They discussed some of the issues and the recent signed orders from the WH. Some of this discussion sounded intelligent, as if they had researched not only the issue, but how to present it to get the buy-in from the group. It felt to us like a persuasion/programming tactic.
They broke into their teams and anyone not on a team was asked to choose one to sit in on. We each went to a different team. Each team talked about their mission and their strategy. The phone team assigned times for each phone call and a number to text after you called. They practiced scripts. The Anti-Abortion team talked about how to plan protests at PP and other clinics, to find the names of Doctors who perform abortions and out them by protesting at their offices and clinics. The communications team discussed the content of their newsletter, the content they were borrowing from other newsletters and articles from Briebart that they wanted to circulate. We didn’t get the names of the other teams that we didn’t sit in on but there were 4 others.
We found out that this group used to be a young republican group and after the election and seeing the actions of the Liberals, they changed to a support little d group to stand up for him and against Liberals.
I don’t believe all groups are this scary, however, they appear to be organized. One of the members in one of my groups, changed her registration to Republican so she could see what they do from the inside. She gets phone calls from a phone bank,sometimes several times a week, about issues and actions she should take, she gets their weekly newsletter and she attended a local Rep meeting. Her report is similar only in that they are very organized, take daily actions and communicate often.
So knowing this, what do we do?
Our recommendations:
1.) Don’t give up.
2.) If you Marched, email your local police to write a thank you for their part in keeping the peace.
3.) Get organized. Even if you are not with an organized local group, you can organize yourself. Set aside certain times for certain actions based on what you CAN do. We are all under time constraints and work/family/life commitments, however, find what time you CAN give. **We have found that being with an organized local group that you can see and touch helps us to stay focused and feeling our strength.
4.) Determine what actions you CAN take – when and how many phone calls, emails, visits, protests CAN you do. Focus on that.
5.) Limit your time reading all the comments on FB. Too many can become overwhelming and can end up feeling like you are carrying a larger burden.
6.) Find and cross post the good results that are happening, so we can all see the progress. It may be small steps like the postponement of a cabinet position approval/rejection, however, every step counts. If you have ever attempted to lose weight, you remember how some days feel like nothing is happening, and then little by little the results start to appear. Whatever goal you have reached in little steps, remember the little steps got the momentum started. Stay strong.
7.) Find support when you need it. It’s been shown that if you vent to someone who is also venting, you both stay in the same spot. If you can vent to someone who will HEAR you without judgement and without chiming in, you can both get through it faster and back to feeling stronger. If you both need to vent, take turns; 2 minutes each venting and really HEAR each other, then switch places. When the venting is done, take a positive action.
8.) Take a break. Do something positive for yourself every day (more a few times during the day if you need it) that doesn’t include thinking about politics – exercise, spas, reading a good book, writing a love letter. Find something that bring you joy and shifts your energy.
9.) Don’t give up. We are Stronger Together.
The opposition may believe that a snowflake is fragile when the heat is on, however, although the snowflakes may melt, enough heat can also cause a boil. Together, we can be an avalanche, and if we can focus our boiling angry energy we can be the heat that they fear.

VERY INTERESTING REPORT! WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION!

",Liberal,MonteLukast,0,1,2017-01-27,1181,"A View From Inside An old friend posted this on Facebook.  It's long but well worth reading.  Multiply it by a couple hundred and it illustrates just a little of what we're all up against. 

A VIEW FROM THE INSIDE OF THE OTHER SIDE
Last night I attended a Pro-President “little d” meeting. My summary will be a bit long, however, I want to pass on what we learned,
In the Art of War it is always advised to know what your enemy is doing, that is why there are spies. Two of the groups I’m involved with have a committee that is subscribed to little d’s supporters newsletters, are members of various FB groups (with specially created profiles) and are on his mailing list for updates.
Last night 3 of us went to a group meeting. Two women and one man. What we saw and heard was both scary and informative.
The meeting was led by 5 men and we counted approximately 70 people in the room including us. We counted 13 women.
They started the meeting with a pledge of allegiance to the flag. Then they jumped into discussions, the first being the Marches. It was a lot of WTF and why don’t they just shut up. They discussed the report that there were no arrests so that meant that the police and the media were lying. The leader(s) then gave them an “action item” to find anything to dispute the no arrests report and to put pressure on the police to arrest protestors. Several people in the group admitted to being at the March to try to interfere, but felt they were bullied by the Marchers and had to stop “for their own safety” (actual quote). They questioned why so many people “got away with it” (Marching). It seemed to be a hot point with them.
The moved on to reports from the teams. They have teams and committees with specific tasks, ie: daily phone calls and collect tally’s of who makes phone calls to their Reps. It appears they call throughout the day, and each call is either a different issue or their personal favorite.
They have a team who monitor the public blogs and event postings of the Liberal groups (specifically mentioned Indivisible and MoveOn.) They laughed at the Indivisible Guide when one leader said “the Liberals will never get organized and carry any of this out, the snowflakes give up too easily, a little heat and they melt”. They talked about the “visit your representatives office event” that was planned for earlier in the day which was posted on MoveOn and all over FB. They also were at their reps offices, and a handful admitted to going to the Democratic representatives office in their own district to have their voice counted.
They have a team who spies on FB posts. When the man who was with us asked how to do it, he was told that if he was a member of Pantsuit Nation it’s almost an automatic in into most closed groups, and then once you are in one, you can get invited to others. Someone on their team joins all the public and open groups. Their report included reading a few actual posts, in a mimic whining voice, where the members were posting their concerns and frustrations and why bother. They actually cheered this.

-Trying to repeal conservation laws to increase logging, drilling, etc.

""Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,

With conquering limbs astride from land to land;

Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand

Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command

The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.

“Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” cries she

With silent lips. “Give me your tired, your poor,

Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,

Is the Muslim ban simply a cover? Pay very close attention over the next several days...,"""I don't like to talk about politics on Facebook-- political history is my job, after all, and you are my friends-- but there is an important non-partisan point to make today. 

What Bannon is doing, most dramatically with last night's ban on immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries-- is creating what is known as a ""shock event."" Such an event is unexpected and confusing and throws a society into chaos. People scramble to react to the event, usually along some fault line that those responsible for the event can widen by claiming that they alone know how to restore order. When opponents speak out, the authors of the shock event call them enemies. As society reels and tempers run high, those responsible for the shock event perform a sleight of hand to achieve their real goal, a goal they know to be hugely unpopular, but from which everyone has been distracted as they fight over the initial event. There is no longer concerted opposition to the real goal; opposition divides along the partisan lines established by the shock event.

Last night's Executive Order has all the hallmarks of a shock event. It was not reviewed by any governmental agencies or lawyers before it was released, and counterterrorism experts insist they did not ask for it. People charged with enforcing it got no instructions about how to do so. Courts immediately have declared parts of it unconstitutional, but border police in some airports are refusing to stop enforcing it. 

Predictably, chaos has followed and tempers are hot.

My point today is this: unless you are the person setting it up, it is in no one's interest to play the shock event game. It is designed explicitly to divide people who might otherwise come together so they cannot stand against something its authors think they won't like. I don't know what Bannon is up to-- although I have some guesses-- but because I know Bannon's ideas well, I am positive that there is not a single person whom I consider a friend on either side of the aisle-- and my friends range pretty widely-- who will benefit from whatever it is. If the shock event strategy works, though, many of you will blame each other, rather than Bannon, for the fallout. And the country will have been tricked into accepting their real goal. 

But because shock events destabilize a society, they can also be used positively. We do not have to respond along old fault lines. We could just as easily reorganize into a different pattern that threatens the people who sparked the event. A successful shock event depends on speed and chaos because it requires knee-jerk reactions so that people divide along established lines. This, for example, is how Confederate leaders railroaded the initial southern states out of the Union. If people realize they are being played, though, they can reach across old lines and reorganize to challenge the leaders who are pulling the strings. This was Lincoln's strategy when he joined together Whigs, Democrats, Free-Soilers, anti-Nebraska voters, and nativists into the new Republican Party to stand against the Slave Power. Five years before, such a coalition would have been unimaginable. Members of those groups agreed on very little other than that they wanted all Americans to have equal economic opportunity. Once they began to work together to promote a fair economic system, though, they found much common ground. They ended up rededicating the nation to a ""government of the people, by the people, and for the people."" 

Confederate leaders and Lincoln both knew about the political potential of a shock event. As we are in the midst of one, it seems worth noting that Lincoln seemed to have the better idea about how to use it.""


The post is not mine. It originated from a person named Heather Richardson (apparently she's on the top search result for shock event). And I would appreciate it if it were shared to other left leaning forums so we can maintain focus (I would love to, but the ten minute rule). Thanks.

"Should The State Protect Individuals From ""The Tyranny of Prevailing Opinion?""","Hi ladies and gentlemen!

I hate to interrupt the awesome memes and articles with a discussion, but I'm trying to get a feel for how contemporary political movements view one of liberalism's founding principles: liberty. 
____________________

In his masterful essay, [On Liberty](http://socserv2.socsci.mcmaster.ca/econ/ugcm/3ll3/mill/liberty.pdf), J.S. Mill sets the stage for one of the most enduring questions in modern political philosophy: what is liberty and what is the state's role in protecting it?

**Defining Liberty**

For Mill, liberty is comprised of three principles. Violating any of these principles is tyrannical.

&gt;It comprises, first, the inward domain of consciousness; demanding liberty of conscience, in the most comprehensive sense; liberty of thought and feeling; **absolute freedom of opinion and sentiment on all subjects**, practical or speculative, scientific, moral, or theological. The **liberty of expressing and publishing opinions** may seem to fall under a different principle, since it belongs to that part of the conduct of an individual which concerns other people; but, being almost of as much importance as the liberty of thought itself, and resting in great part on the same reasons, is practically inseparable from it. Secondly, the principle requires **liberty of tastes and pursuits**; of framing the plan of our life to suit our own character; of doing as we like, subject to such consequences as may follow: without impediment from our fellow-creatures, so long as what we do does not harm them, even though they should think our conduct foolish, perverse, or wrong. Thirdly, from this liberty of each individual, follows the liberty, within the same limits, of combination among individuals; **freedom to unite, for any purpose not involving harm to others**: the persons combining being supposed to be of full age, and not forced or deceived.

&gt;No society in which these liberties are not, on the whole, respected, is free, whatever may be its form of government; and none is completely free in which they do not exist absolute and unqualified.

If you disagree with this definition of liberty please explain your objection. Otherwise we will use it as a baseline for discussion.

**Enlightenment Extended**

Whereas enlightenment thinkers believed that organized, authoritative bodies (e.g. the state and the church) represent the greatest threats to liberty, Mill recognized a potent threat from the prevailing opinion of unorganized masses:

&gt;When society is itself the tyrant [...] its means of tyrannizing are not restricted to the acts which it may do by the hands of its political functionaries. Society can and does execute its own mandates: and if it issues wrong mandates instead of right, or any mandates at all in things which it ought not to meddle, it practices a social tyranny more formidable than many kinds of political oppression, since, though not usually held by such extreme penalties, it leaves fewer means of escape, penetrating much more deeply into the details of life, and enslaving the soul itself. **Protection, therefore, against the tyranny of the magistrate is not enough; there needs protection also against the tyranny of the prevailing opinion and feeling;** against the tendency of society to impose, by other means than civil penalties, its own ideas and practices as rules of conduct on those who dissent from them.


Enlightenment thinkers proposed that, to protect against systemic tyranny, we design our governing systems with limiting internal controls. Hence western political systems emphasize representative government, constitutional limitations on government, separation of church and state, etc. But how do we combat the organic tyranny of majoritarian opinion without tyrannizing the majority?

**Case #1** 

In 2014 [Masterpiece Cakeshop](http://aclu-co.org/court-rules-bakery-illegally-discriminated-against-gay-couple/) owner Jack Phillips refused to bake a wedding cake for engaged gay couple David Mullins and Charlie Craig claiming his religious convictions as the reason for his discrimination. The couple filed a complaint with the Colorado Civil Rights Division contending that Phillips had violated state anti-discrimination laws. A CCRD ruling in the couple's favor led to an appeal by Phillips to the Colorado Office of Administrative Courts. The court upheld the prior ruling and ordered Phillips to pay associated fines, take re-education classes on discrimination, file quarterly compliance reports with the CCRD for two years, and make wedding cakes for any prospective gay clients. Further appeals were denied, and Phillips chose to close his bakery instead of violate his beliefs.

If we treat the religious community's refusal to participate in gay weddings as a Millsian social tyranny on the gay minority then the state's intrusion can be justified as a promotion of social liberty. On the other hand, many would argue that Colorado's laws tyrannize devoutly religious business owners by forcing them to choose between betraying their religious convictions and going out of business. Is liberty served by these types of anti-discrimination laws? Is there another way to ensure that minority communities are protected from this type of social tyranny?

**Case #2**

In May 2016 [liberal activists interrupted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/05/25/speech-by-conservative-speaker-milo-yiannopoulos-shut-down-by-protesters-at-depaul-police-and-security-dont-intervene/?utm_term=.8f97b760cfbc) ([video](https://youtu.be/Pw-MnRyIoQY?t=46m33s)) a DePaul University College Republicans event hosting conservative columnist Milo Yiannopoulos. To shut down political speech the activists blew whistles, took over the stage, stole the microphones from Yiannopoulos and the interviewer, and threatened physical violence against Yiannopoulos. The event was eventually canceled after school administrators told campus security and the Chicago PD, who were both present, not to interrupt the protest. 

Mill would argue that the liberal activists' attempt to shut down political speech represents an affront to liberty and a social tyranny. How can we ensure that freedom of expression is preserved in our society amid a significant, organic movement to silence certain viewpoints? Is there a way the state can protect freedom of expression from organic threats without becoming tyrannical towards protest movements?",Liberal,LeastDisplayOfMind,0,3,2016-12-11,1228,"Should The State Protect Individuals From ""The Tyranny of Prevailing Opinion?""

An update on our war on Christmas,"Liberals, we gotta do better.


We haven't made headway in the War on Christmas in ages. The Real Americans have built up a tolerance to our ""Happy Holidays"" assault, it's just not garnering complaints the way it used to. Number of Christmas lights and trees sold saw a spike this year. They're actually starting to push back on our occupied territories on the Starbucks cups.


At this rate, Christian values may survive another year. Our ""black Santa in the Mall of America"" offensive was successful but other than that we really have nothing current to show for our efforts. Here are a few suggestions as to how we move forward:


1.)Replace ""Happy Holidays"" with ""Happy Winter!""


""Happy Holidays"" really drove Real America nuts. If we want to get back to those levels of outrage we have to go even more vague. ""Holidays"" was good but it still implies that Christmas could be a holiday among the others. ""Happy Winter"" would be even MORE vague, and doesn't even suggest that there are holidays.


2.)Replace Santa in all malls with Mrs. Clause.


There's no reason why we can't ruin Christmas AND the patriarchy. Tell all the children at the mall during the Happy Winter season that the Clauses are taking a stand against archaic gender roles so Mrs. Clause Will be taking the sleigh out every Christmas while Santa stays home and bakes the cookies. Oh, and don't forget that she's black too.(side note: we need to learn her first name, so she won't be relegated to being his ""Mrs."") And speaking of women in prominent roles:


3.)Rudolph(ine) is trans now.


Rudolphine's gender identity has zero impact on her ability to do her aerial navigation job but trust me, this will drive them CRAZY. Real America needs to be certain of everyone's gender status at all times, and any uncertainty can be exploited as a valuable source of outrage. Also if anyone brings up her unique nasal situation be sure to chastise them for othering her and remind them of the merits of body positivity.


4.)Introduce worker's rights into the elf narrative.


The elves can work in the workshop that's fine, but make sure to tell children that the elves have a union and that they make a minimum of $15 an hour. Remind them that the North Pole could not function without socialism and that the Clauses are making sure that they all have universal healthcare.


Aaand that should do it. I'm going to print this out to be tacked onto the bulletin board in the break rooms of all Whole Foods and Mom's organic Markets. I've also CC'ed this to the head of Toyota's Prius division and over to the folks at Jezebel.

He was the first truly Conservative President, in the sense of believing in conservative economic orthodoxy, since the 1920s. Eisenhower and Nixon were conservative socially, but embraced Centrist or Liberal domestic policies.

Reagan could easily have worked to undo Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid; instead, he helped in the 1983 effort to save Social Security. Incomes rose during this period, and it was the last high water mark for the middle class.

I believe Reagan's policies (trickle down, and deregulation) were harmful in the longterm, but in the short term during his Presidency, it resulted in prosperity. Reagan cut taxes on top earners, but then again, so did JFK and LBJ, our most Liberal Presidents.

The black mark that will forever tarnish the Reagan Presidency is his horrible handling of the AIDs crisis, and that can't be forgiven. But every single President - even FDR, our greatest President - has a few questionable black marks on their record(s). 

Reagan seemed to truly love America and at the very least, truly believed in his ideals - even if we as Liberals disagree with them. He was a family man who clearly deeply loved his wife, and is one of the few Presidents post 1960 who doesn't seem to have been unfaithful. 

He didn't undo Social Security; He wasn't a Fascist; He looks, to me, with hindsight, like a choir boy next to our lovely ""President-elect"", and our Speaker, who seem to think they have some mandate to undo Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.

Perhaps it's just that George W. Bush was so inept, and Trump is so utterly heinous, that in hindsight, Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan don't look so bad. Even Nixon, compared to Trump, looks tame. Nixon at least had a great intellect and intellectual curiosity and actually did his best to increase our international standing. Trump neither has any real interest in governing and seeks for us to be little more than Russia's puppet on the world stage.",Liberal,Felix_Jaeger,9,4,2016-12-15,1224,"Was Ronald Reagan really so bad, in retrospect?

Who can hear the words to the song of our nation?,"
  I was thinking about our nation and how we are so polarized. But we all believe we love this country and what it represents.
I came up with this thought, that we are all listening to the same song but only half of us actually are listening or can hear the lyrics.  The other side just loves the ""sound"" of the song.
As an example of what the other half is not hearing when listening to the song;

From  the inscription on the Statue of Liberty;

""Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!""

The way they are screwing up our Healthcare scares me....,"So, what is the plan? The republicans and Paul Ryan are planning to gut Medicare and replace it with a voucher system that effectively will privatize it. This is expected to pass because there is enough of a Majority in congress that a filibuster won't stop it. The only way to stop it is through a veto with Trump which he won't do.
Meanwhile, Healthcare, which was the main cause of so much Bankruptcy being declared from 2002 until 2009 (nothing else even came close including unemployment!), is going to suffer. Obamacare may not be the answer, but it certainly held things together and was a quick fix for several problems the Insurance Companies used to throw people off their coverage.
So I have read/heard all the Paul Ryan claims that his plans would be so much better than Medicare. Yet, all I see happening so far is it turning Medical care into even more of a for-profit venture. You will be treated even more like a customer by a doctor than you will be a patient. Basically, the gist of Ryan's proposals would be for Medicare NOT to pay your Doctor Bill. It would pay you with a voucher... (AKA Coupon) which states ""This person gets say $500 worth of healthcare this month. Use it wisely.""
But the problem with that is the cost of care &amp; drugs, especially for senior citizens and people who are too old to work anymore.
Truth is I fear we are really putting a tremendous burden on the backs of America's seniors, and insuring the next few generations of seniors must continue to work until disease or health puts them into a place where they can no longer function at all. Then, there coverage and care would be limited to how much money they have in their voucher account.
My point is.... This sounds like nothing more than a quick fix that will give us twenty times the problems in the future. Trump said during one of the debates he was IN FAVOR of a single payer system for healthcare. Why did he change his tune? Was it Political pressure from the Insurance lobbyists and the Republicans who have always wanted to dismantle Medicare and Social Security?",Liberal,gettotallygayaboutit,2,1,2016-12-16,1223,"The way they are screwing up our Healthcare scares me....

Senate Committee Phone Numbers,"Hey everybody,

I couldn't find a compilation of anywhere of the contact info for the members of the various Senate Committees, so I made one for people who want to target the appropriate people regarding specific cabinet appointments and legislation. Regardless of your views, I think this election has exposed a lot of dysfunction in the political system, and shown our democracy to be very unhealthy. Democracy is what happens in the years between elections, and I'm hoping that this period drives up civic engagement across America. These are high-stakes times we're living through.

",Liberal,baskingturtles,0,1,2016-12-19,1220,"Senate Committee Phone Numbers Hey everybody,

I couldn't find a compilation of anywhere of the contact info for the members of the various Senate Committees, so I made one for people who want to target the appropriate people regarding specific cabinet appointments and legislation. Regardless of your views, I think this election has exposed a lot of dysfunction in the political system, and shown our democracy to be very unhealthy. Democracy is what happens in the years between elections, and I'm hoping that this period drives up civic engagement across America. These are high-stakes times we're living through.

Do you have any tips for debating liberals?,"I don't mean anyone any offense by this post and what I'm about to say obviously doesn't apply to everyone 

As I'm sure you can tell by the title, I'm a conservative. I also enjoy debating and seeing the other side of things, but with a lot of liberals doing that is impossible. 

How it usually goes is, I say something, they use a one liner of some sort, I refute it, they insult me, then become very dismissive or stop responding. 


Another problem I have is it is very hard to tell a liberal something new or something they don't agree with. They usually try to twist your words around so it seems like you are saying something diffident then you are, or they argue against a point you aren't even making.

One more, what sources do you consider credible? They usually call sources like ny post, Wall Street journal, daily mail, and sometimes even CNN untrustworthy. 

The last one, and this one annoys me the most, how to I get them to actually take a stance? They are usually much more focused on telling me in wrong and not elaborating on how then they are on actually presenting an opposing view.
